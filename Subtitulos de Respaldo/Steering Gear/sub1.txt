As a result of studying this section you will know the parameters essential for
00:05
the size of the steering gear be able to explain how the bearing forces act know
00:11
the principles of the most-used rudder arrangements
00:35
in order to move the rudder the steering gear has to create a certain talk the
00:41
torque requirement is given by the class rules to ensure safe maneuverability of
00:46
the vessel the size and shape of the rudder and also the speed of the vessel
00:51
is taken into consideration
00:55
rudder arrangement is also exposed to these forces current forces created by
01:00
propeller and waves gravity of components and ship movement side forces
01:06
when turning the forces depend upon the type and size of rudder and also the

rudder arrangement

click the buttons to get more information about the different rudder
01:18
arrangements Spade rudder 1/2 Spade rudder flap rudder
01:25
this is the most used rudder type on ferries and smaller boats this type of
01:30
rudder gives very good maneuverability depending on the available rudder angle
01:35
and the rudder profile
01:40
this type of rudder is most commonly used on big vessels this rudder is not
01:46
as effective as a spade rudder of the same size
01:52
this type of rudder is used when very good maneuverability is required the
01:58
rear thin exaggerate s-- the movement of the rudder making the rudder more
02:02
effective
