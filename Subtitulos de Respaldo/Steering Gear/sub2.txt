As a result of studying this section you will learn the working principles of the
00:05
standard model of the rotary vane actuator to working principles of the
00:10
IMO model of the rotary vane actuator how the IMO system reacts to a leakage
00:15
the working principles of the RAM type actuator
00:39
basically there are two types of electro hydraulic steering gear working
00:44
principles the RAM type and the rotary vane type the working principles of the
00:49
two are very similar a strong slow movement of a mechanical surface is
00:54
created by the use of high oil pressure ram type uses cylinder pistons rotary
01:00
vane uses pressure working on the side of a vane on the RAM type the piston is
01:05
connected by a ram to a tiller and the tiller is fixed to the rudder stopped
01:09
creating the rotating movement on the rotary vane the vane is fixed to a boss
01:14
that is fixed directly to the stock the principles as described for the rotary
01:19
vane steering gear can easily be transformed to the RAM type typical for
01:25
RAM type steering gears is that they work with a much higher hydraulic
01:28
pressure they need an external rudder stock bearing and the working angle is
01:33
limited compared with the rotary vane steering gear the standard model is used
01:38
on all vessels except tankers with single rudder installation above 100,000
01:43
deadweight tons safety safety against single failure on the hydraulic system
01:49
according to sonís rules the IMO model is specially designed for tankers with
01:56
single rudder installation above 100,000 deadweight tons to comply with the
02:01
soleus rules it can also be used for other ships and/or rudder arrangements
02:06
where extraordinary safety is wanted safety safety against single failure on
02:12
the hydraulic system according to Solace rules

this is a schematic drawing of the standard steering gear you can click on
02:26
the buttons marked Porsche or starboard to see how it works and click on the
02:30
different parts for more information the model shows a normal operation situation
02:35
with one pump running using both pumps will double the speed of the rudder

you

you will now be shown how the IMO system reacts on a leakage

04:40
you
05:31
the iro steering-gear is redundant for leakage over the vein seals so if the
05:36
oil can bypass one of the veins for any accidental reason the leaking vein can
05:41
be put out of function and the steering gear will operate on the other vein only
05:45
however if a leakage should occur over one of the stoppers both veins will be
05:50
inoperable a situation like this is not covered by the soleus class requirements
05:55
the double IMO will protect against accidental bypass over one of the
06:00
stoppers as well the double IMO is designed for ship owners who want the
06:04
most ultimate safety further than required by the sonís or class rules
06:11
the purpose of the locking device is to fix the rudder in any position and may
06:16
be used during maintenance of steering gear
06:20
anchoring
06:24
or towing
