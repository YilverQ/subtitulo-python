On section you should be able to identify and understand the
00:04
function of the main parts of the actuator housing
00:31
rotor
00:34
Stoppers
00:37
cover
00:41
radial bearing
00:46
rutter carrier
00:52
the actuator is situated on top of rather stock in the steering gear
00:56
compartment the rotor in the rotary vane actuator is mounted directly on the
01:02
rudder stock on the RAM type the tiller is fixed to the rudder stock the rudder
01:07
stock connects the actuator with a rudder
01:16
this is the rudder stock it is tapered on top to fit the rotor this is the
01:22
rotor it is mounted to the rudder stock by the use of a hydraulic jack these are
01:27
the bearings for the rotor upper and lower radial bearing and the rudder
01:31
carrier this is the actuator housing these are the stop herb mounting bars
01:36
these are the stoppers which serve a dual purpose together with the rotor
01:42
vanes the stoppers divide the actuator in two pressure chambers and also make
01:47
boundaries for the maximum rudder angle this is the lower packing gland this is
01:52
the base for the actuator this cover forms the top of the pressure chambers
01:56
this is the ring Jack it is used during installation to force the rotor onto the
02:02
rudder stock this is the rudder stock knot this is the mounting plate for the
02:07
angle indicator this is the angle indicator shaft this is the system oil
02:13
expansion tank this is the angle indicator wheel these nuts
02:18
lock down the cover stoppers and oil gasket with these the actuator is
02:23
complete please be aware that this sequence for putting the actuator
02:27
together is different from real life
02:32
click on the split drawing of the actuator for information about the
02:36
different parts
02:41
angle indicator
02:45
this is fixed to the rudder stock and shows the rudder angle
02:51
expansion tank
02:56
this tank serves as a for the system oil
03:02
rudder stock nut
03:06
this nut acts as a securing device for the friction connection between the
03:10
rudder stock and the rotor
03:14
Stoppers
03:17
make boundaries for the chambers and also set the limits for the
03:22
rudder angle to each side
03:27
Stoppers
03:30
make boundaries for the pressure chambers and also set the limits for the
03:35
rudder angle to each side rotor
03:43
this is the moving part of the actuator it turns the rudder stock when
03:48
the hydraulic pressure increases on either side of its veins it is fitted
03:52
with spring-loaded cast iron bars these are not exposed to wear
04:00
housing
04:05
serves as the outer boundaries side and bottom of the pressure chambers
04:13
rudder stock
04:17
this is the connecting shaft between the rotor and the rudder
04:23
lower radial bearing
04:28
the lower radial bearing takes up radial forces in conjunction with upper radial
04:32
bearing it is made of brass this bearing is lubricated by the system oil
04:42
lower packing gland
04:47
this keeps the system oil from leaking down the rudder stock after the system
04:51
oil has lubricated the lower side bearing and the rudder carrier
04:58
ring jack
05:01
this is used during installation to force the rotor onto the rudder stock
05:10
cover
05:13
the cover forms the chambers
