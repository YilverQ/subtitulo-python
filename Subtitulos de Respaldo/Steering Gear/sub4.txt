As a result of studying this section you will learn rules in general requirements
00:06
concerning the steering gear so last 2004 chapter 5 regulation 25
00:34
this is the administrative hierarchy that has been established by the United
00:38
Nations in order to develop an international standard of rules covering
00:43
maritime matters United Nations United Nations headquarters in New York I M Oh
00:51
International Maritime Organization this committee consists of representatives
00:56
from all the member countries i M O made the soleus rules solace safety of lives
01:05
at sea a comprehensive set of rules made by IMO to ensure safety at sea class
01:13
rules these are rules set by the class companies such as DMV they're not go
01:21
Veritas l RS Lloyd's Register of shipping abs American Bureau of shipping
01:30
GL gimana sure Lloyd and others for regular ships the rudder must be able to
01:37
turn a minimum of 35 degrees to each side to meet the rules concerning rudder
01:44
angle velocity the rudder must be able to turn from 35 degrees to 30 degrees on
01:49
the other side in maximum 28 seconds this is called the minimum angle
01:55
velocity the steering gear must be big enough to turn the rudder to 35 degrees
02:01
port and starboard at full speed this torque is achieved at a certain oils
02:07
on the veins of the rotor the safety valve is set at a corresponding oil
02:12
pressure minimum 25% above this when the safety valves open the oil is allowed to
02:19
bypass the vanes in addition the steering gear is to be pressure tested
02:23
with a much higher pressure this is done by the manufacturer before delivery the
02:29
hydraulic system should be designed so that single failure doesn't put the
02:34
steering gear out of function the procedure diagram for emergency
02:39
steering should be easily seen in the wheelhouse
02:42
and steering gear compartment the emergency steering is done by the use of
02:47
the non follow-up push buttons on the starter cabinet or directly on the
02:52
directional valves on the steering gear the system shall be looked after by
02:57
monitoring important functions specified in the rules such as oil levels and
03:02
power supply the monitoring is done by placing sensors in these important areas
03:08
these sensors by the one by one or in combination activate different alarms
03:14
the operator of the steering gear must have the necessary competence the
03:19
steering gears vital functions are to be regularly checked by the crew and the
03:24
crew are to be drilled in emergency procedures
03:29
chapter 5 regulation 25 operation of steering gear in areas where navigation
03:36
de bombs special caution ships shall have more than one steering gear power
03:41
unit in operation when such units are capable of simultaneous operation
03:45
chapter 5 regulation 26 steering gear testing and drills one within 12 hours
03:54
before departure the ship's steering gear shall be checked and tested by the
03:59
ship's crew the test procedure shall include where applicable the operation
04:05
of the following point 1 the main steering gear point to the auxilary
04:12
steering gear point 3 the remote steering gear control systems point for
04:19
the steering positions located on the navigation bridge point 5 the emergency
04:26
power supply point 6 the rudder angle indicators in relation to the actual
04:32
position of the rudder point 7 the remote steering gear control system
04:38
power failure alarms point 8 the steering gear power unit failure alarms
04:45
and point 9 automatic isolating arrangements and other automatic
04:51
equipment
