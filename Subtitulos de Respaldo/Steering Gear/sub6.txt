As a result of studying this section you will know what could cause an emergency
00:06
situation know what to do when an emergency situation occurs be able to
00:12
locate all emergency valves on the actuator
00:28
you
00:35
you
00:37
emergency steering is the same as local steering from the steering gear
00:41
compartment the operator has to push directly on the valves on the actuator
00:46
and keep his eyes on the rudder angle indicator wheel on the top of the
00:50
actuator rudder commands are to be received by phone from the bridge local
00:56
steering can also be done from the starter cabinets front panel
01:02
situations in which local steering may be necessary failure on the rudder or
01:07
rudder indication system bridge out of function
01:12
cable breakage
01:15
it is extremely important that the procedure for switching over to local
01:19
steering mode is familiar and drilled so everyone involved knows what to do this
01:26
is described in detail on the operating instructions I grabbed which hangs on
01:31
the bulkhead in the wheelhouse and in the steering gear compartment you should
01:36
study this operating instruction diagram on your vessel and go down to the
01:41
steering gear compartment to become familiar with the emergency steering
01:45
controls the controls may vary on different types of steering gear on the
01:50
following pages you will be shown the operating instructions I am click on the
01:55
hot spots to read the procedures changeover procedure start or stop of
02:02
pumps can be done from the bridge pumps are independent of each other pumps can
02:07
operate the steering gear independently or together each pump has its own
02:12
independent steering control circuit following valves have to be in open
02:17
position a b c d e and f electrical or valve block failure alarm one one pump
02:28
in operation 1.1.1 start standby pump if not also started one point one point to
02:38
stop the pump with failure function to two pumps in operation two point one
02:46
point one stop pump with failure function caution in some circumstances
02:53
the rudder may not respond to helm and no alarm is given if this happens
02:59
proceed as follows one point two point one change to non follow up steering

03:34
the rudder indicator if none go to two point two point three two point two
03:41
point three start pump number one again and stop pump number two control the
03:48
rudder movement on the rudder indicator steering from the steering gear
03:52
compartment start and stop of pumps can be done in steering gear compartment
03:57
switch off B 1 and B 2 a by use of the non follow up switch in front of starter
04:04
or B by activating ll or mm depending on which pump in operation
04:14
open valve k valve e and f are normally open closed valve k after refilling the
04:22
steering gear has to be refilled through one steering gear pump by using the
04:26
storage tank system closed valves a and B or C and D
