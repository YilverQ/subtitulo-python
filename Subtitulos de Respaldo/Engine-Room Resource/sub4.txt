00:00
now today's job search replaced number
00:02
one and three cylinder fuel injection
00:04
valves the main engine replaced number
00:06
one cylinder fuel injection valve on
00:07
number two generator three new motor
00:09
bearings on number one main cooling sea
00:11
water pump change over the sea chest
00:14
from low to high and clean the sea
00:16
strainer and maintain a cargo watch
00:21
anything else I have periodical
00:25
maintenance of number one lopa fire how
00:28
many hours do you need to do that as I
00:32
have already opened bull assembly while
00:33
it was hot to make it easy to clean up I
00:35
guess about two hours to complete third
00:39
engineer regarding the fuel valve of
00:42
number two generator was there any sign
00:43
of high temperature although I looked at
00:46
monitor display I thought there was no
00:48
problem at the time of start and I was
00:50
checking other points I therefore was
00:52
not aware of it it was a little higher
00:55
than the other soon after starting but I
00:58
thought such a difference was acceptable
01:02
but you should have informed us of
01:04
anything you found even if it was only
01:06
slightly different from normal if you
01:08
had reported it we would pay more
01:09
careful attention to it and we might
01:11
possibly have addressed the situation
01:13
before the alarm sounded that's right
01:17
however you said that replacing the fuel
01:20
valve should not be done during standby
01:22
engine that was great it was nice that
01:25
you questioned us when you felt that
01:27
something we asked you to do was not the
01:28
right thing to do in the situation yes
01:31
thanks I will try to tell you about
01:34
anything I find that is slightly
01:35
abnormal from now on third engineer it
01:41
seems to be easy to change over the sea
01:43
chest and to inspect and clean the sea
01:45
strainer but you had better do it very
01:49
carefully because only opening the lid
01:52
of the strainer can cause unexpected
01:53
problems
01:55
the other day they tried to open the lid
01:58
of a strainer and this lid was instantly
02:01
blown off soon after they removed the
02:03
securing dogs consequently a large
02:07
amount of sea water came into the engine
02:09
room of course they had confirmed that
02:14
there was no water pressure by opening
02:15
the air vent valve but it was found
02:17
later that the air vent valve was
02:18
clogged with rubbish and rusty besides
02:20
which the seawater suction valve was
02:22
being held slightly open with seagrass
02:24
therefore at least when you open the lid
02:27
of strainer you should confirm that
02:28
there is no pressure inside the strainer
02:29
after just loosening the securing dogs
02:31
and only then should you remove the
02:33
securing dogs okay understood that's
02:38
right now how should we distribute the
02:40
work tasks mr. Sato and I will take the
02:43
main engine second engineer in mr.
02:45
Yamamoto take number 2 generator and
02:47
third engineer and number one take the
02:50
sea chest and sea strainer third
02:52
engineer you work on number one ello
02:54
purifier after that the second engineer
02:57
you should confirm condition of number
02:59
two generator with load running after
03:00
replacing the fuel injection valve I
03:02
guess you can complete it in hour so you
03:05
should work on renewing the motor
03:06
bearings of number one main cooling sea
03:08
water pump after the generator regarding
03:10
the cargo watch I will talk to the deck
03:12
Department about that as we will have to
03:14
prioritize maintenance work if there's
03:15
something wrong with cargo watch let me
03:17
know is there anything else to talk over
03:21
now today's work will be carried out at
03:24
several places and please do communicate
03:28
with each other if you have a problem
03:30
then if you have done something unusual
03:33
and made any adjustment concerning your
03:36
work needless to say you should let
03:38
everyone know you should write it on the
03:42
Status board as well as leave a note in
03:45
the work record book third engineer you
03:48
work on the periodical maintenance of
03:50
the yellow purifier and don't forget to
03:52
follow the procedures including
03:53
isolating the appropriate valves
03:56
there was a case with a certain ship
03:58
while undocking when there was an
04:00
incident that let fuel-oil blow off from
04:02
the safety valve of fuel oil heater when
04:04
they started the fo booster pump as all
04:07
personnel were closely involved they
04:09
only looked into the safety valve and
04:11
pressure regulating valve and it was
04:13
hard to find that the cause was the
04:15
returned valve was closed aside from
04:19
this the problem was that no one knew
04:21
how that valve which was usually not
04:23
closed had come to be closed and also on
04:29
another ship one engineer tried to
04:31
adjust a diaphragm type pressure
04:32
regulating valve for steam pressure by
04:34
hand and broke the diaphragm plate not
04:37
being aware of existence of the stopper
04:40
volt this happened because he was not
04:43
aware of how the stopper bolt worked
04:45
although his unawareness of the stopper
04:47
bolt was questionable the most serious
04:50
problem was that the information about
04:52
how the stopper boat work was not shared
04:55
[Music]
04:56
sharing of information is essential not
04:59
only to standby engine but also to
05:01
maintenance works keep it in mind yes
05:06
certainly let's begin having a meeting
05:14
before maintenance work begins has
05:16
become routine in recent years this is
05:20
because it can be thought that the
05:22
meeting called a toolbox meeting has
05:24
become important due to the
05:26
strengthening of legal restrictions on
05:28
safety and the enhancement of safety
05:30
awareness although a meeting at which
05:32
all members of the engine Department
05:34
attended was seldom held until these
05:36
toolbox meetings became routine
05:43
furthermore there was a background that
05:45
there had been a lack of communication
05:47
caused by the fact that the engine-room
05:50
team is comprised of seafarers from many
05:52
different nationalities and cultures the
05:55
toolbox meeting has as its aim to carry
05:58
out the maintenance work more safely and
06:00
without failures through maintaining an
06:03
exchange of appropriate communications
06:06
the chief engineer explained that
06:09
sharing information in the erm
06:11
principles was important not only for
06:14
operating the ship but also maintenance
06:16
work pointing to two incidents that
06:18
actually happened as examples this is an
06:28
effect of the meeting - and it goes
06:30
without saying that the sharing
06:32
information is built upon an effective
06:34
communication everyone should understand
06:36
this
06:42
from now on let's continue to watch the
06:46
next scene is trial run of main engine
