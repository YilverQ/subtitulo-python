00:25
pilot on board five miles left to the
00:27
birth pilot gut onboard
00:33
five miles left to the birth when they
00:37
begin to use the bow thruster please go
00:39
to generators and pay attention to the
00:41
running condition I will watch main
00:43
engine from near the maneuvering lever
00:44
number one oiler please watch and check
00:47
around cylinder head of main engine
00:49
before approaching the berth let's
00:51
change the sea chest to the high suction
00:52
during the stay in port periodical
00:55
maintenance is scheduled to number one
00:56
hello purifier so let's stop it soon
00:58
that we can open the bowl assembly
01:00
smoothly when we get alongside wouldn't
01:03
it be better to decide whether or not we
01:04
should change sea chest after we make
01:06
sure the depth of the water at the birth
01:08
this time I think if possible it would
01:11
be better to change see just after
01:12
birthing
01:13
because in the past having changed over
01:16
the sea chest after a rough passage air
01:18
went into cooling sea water line and the
01:20
pressure and the line went down almost
01:23
shutting down generators with a blackout
01:26
as we had two days of rough passage
01:29
there is a possibility that air remains
01:31
in high sea chest apart from this you
01:35
would be better to make sure if cleaning
01:37
of the sea strainer is necessary I
01:39
didn't know that such trouble happened
01:41
okay I will ask first engineer for
01:44
instruction pull ahead engine full ahead
01:53
engine
01:58
first engineer I thought I should change
02:01
over the sea chest before birthing as
02:03
usual but as we had two days of rough
02:06
passage if possible I would like to
02:09
change sea chest after birthing making
02:11
sure of the depth of water at the birth
02:13
please give me instruction then as
02:15
periodical maintenance of number one
02:17
lopa fires scheduled during stay in the
02:19
port I would like to stop it in a short
02:22
while so that it is ready for
02:23
maintenance please tell me what you
02:25
would like me to do all right
02:30
regarding sea chest I will instruct you
02:32
after confirming the depth of water at
02:34
the birth
02:34
you can stop number 1 ello purifier
02:37
accordingly all right I will stop number
02:41
1 ello Pyrrha fire accordingly circuit
02:45
engineer asked the bridge about the
02:46
depth of water at the birth yes please
02:51
advise the water depth at the birth
03:01
a depth of nine meters is anticipated
03:03
nine meters is anticipated nine meters
03:08
is anticipated chief the depth of water
03:12
at the berth is nine meters and it's a
03:15
bit risky to use low sea chest until
03:16
nearby the birth isn't it I've been to
03:20
this port in the past and it would be
03:22
okay since an under keel clearance of
03:25
one to two meters can be assured
03:26
considering the tide level and the
03:28
bottom of the water is firm mud it would
03:32
be better to change over the sea chest
03:34
and clean the sea strainer after
03:36
birthday yes I understand the depth of
03:42
water anticipated is 9 meters at the
03:43
berth changing over the sea chest and
03:45
cleaning the sea strainer are to be done
03:47
after berthing all right changing over
03:50
the sea chest and cleaning the sea
03:51
strainer are to be done after berthing
03:55

aft first engineer do you have any
04:46
maintenance work planned for the main
04:48
engine in this port number one in three
04:51
cylinder fuel injection valves are
04:53
planned to be replaced other than this I
04:54
have planned to renew the motor bearing
04:56
of number one main cooling sea water
04:58
pump
04:59
well cargo watch replacing fuel valves
05:02
the main engine replacing fuel valve
05:03
number two generator and so on good work
05:05
planning is necessary then let me see
05:09
how should we do trial run of main
05:12
engine after replacing fuel injection
05:14
valves I guess we don't need to take the
05:15
time as we are only replacing four fuel
05:18
injection valves and it would be okay to
05:19
make sure of the condition during a
05:21
trial run of main engine before
05:22
departure and I will inform captain
05:25
about the replacement of the fuel
05:26
injection valves on the main engine yes
05:29
certainly
05:30
[Music]
05:44
first engineer automatic combustion
05:47
equipment of auxilary boiler is still
05:49
off I will switch it to start
05:51
[Music]
05:53
switch on immediately and start heating
05:55
circulation of fuel oil
05:58
[Music]
06:09
boiler okay automatic combustion
06:12
equipment on heating circulation started
06:15
alright the third engineer must be aware
06:20
of it as the steam pressure a boiler
06:22
seemed to be going down I didn't realize
06:24
that since the monitor does not scan the
06:26
state of the power switch while it's out
06:28
of service and I didn't look at the
06:29
steam pressure does the third engineer
06:32
completely look around the machine yes
06:34
he does
06:35
the third engineer is not very
06:37
experienced but he looks around
06:38
machinery and makes full use of his five
06:40
senses and informs me of anything
06:42
defines so the third engineer fully
06:45
understands his roles and assignments
06:47
and demonstrates leadership at his
06:50
station slow ahead engine slow ahead

08:48
all right finished using bow thruster
08:50
and steering gear finished using bow
08:58
thruster and steering gears switch them
09:00
off now let's work on to put main
09:02
machinery into port condition the scene
09:08
from embarkation of the pilot to
09:10
berthing has been shown firstly let's
09:15
focus on the third engineers leadership
09:20
although the third engineer is not very
09:23
experienced he appropriately issued his
09:25
instructions as the leader of the
09:27
station looking ahead based on precise
09:29
situational awareness it can be said
09:37
that the third engineers leadership and
09:40
situational awareness were demonstrated
09:45
regarding the changeover of the sea
09:48
chest number one oiler contributed to
09:50
the safe navigation of the ship by
09:52
advising the third engineer of his
09:54
experience
09:56
this means that consideration of team
09:58
experience was demonstrated in terms of
10:01
erm
10:08
regarding the replacement of main engine
10:11
fuel injection valves it was important
10:13
that the chief engineer communicated
10:15
this to the captain from the aspect of
10:18
maintaining an exchange of appropriate
10:20
information this was a matter relating
10:23
to main engine and included
10:25
communication that the main engine
10:27
temporarily becomes unable to start even
10:29
though the ship is in port and that
10:32
trial run of the main engine before
10:34
departure is to double up as a test run
10:36
after replacing the fuel injection
10:38
valves as the ship approached the birth
10:44
information relating to movement of the
10:46
ship was informed and engine orders were
10:49
continuously commanded all the
10:54
information was shared by all personnel
10:57
in the control room and the engine room
10:59
this enabled the personnel in charge to
11:02
operate the machinery safely and
11:03
effectively increasing their situational
11:06
awareness about the movement of the ship
11:08
furthermore sharing information can
11:11
build teamwork raises motivation and
11:14
maintains a sense of heightened
11:16
awareness
11:21
