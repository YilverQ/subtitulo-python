heat and noise make the engine room a
02:16
place where you need to stay alert and
02:18
vigilant good housekeeping attention to
02:24
training and safe working practices all
02:26
play a vital part in the pursuit of
02:29
personal safety protective clothing is
02:32
the first barrier against hazards in the
02:34
engine-room overalls with long sleeves
02:37
will protect the skin against dirt and
02:40
abrasion a good fit prevents clothing
02:44
getting caught in moving machinery rings
02:49
and jewelry can also be caught in moving
02:52
machines so remove them before duty
02:58
safety Footwear is designed to be slip
03:01
resistant and to protect your feet from
03:03
heat knocks and cuts overalls and safety
03:09
Footwear are your basic defense against
03:12
injury but in addition you will need
03:15
extra protection in the engine room for
03:17
certain types of work some hard hats are
03:21
designed with a harness inside the shell
03:23
to help absorb the force of impact if
03:26
you use this type of hardhat make sure
03:30
there is an effective clearance between
03:32
the harness and the shell in a noisy
03:36
environment you may need ear defenders
03:43
hardhats protect the head from injury
03:46
caused by knocks against overhead
03:48
structures or from impact caused by
03:50
falling objects
04:00
tools and equipment falling from a
04:02
height are a danger to people below in
04:12
real life it's not possible to wind the
04:14
clock back happily in this video we can
04:22
wearing a hard hat reduces the chance of
04:25
serious injury so always keep your hard
04:29
hat on in designated areas your eyes are
04:35
one of your most important senses and
04:37
sometimes the most vulnerable safety
04:41
glasses and goggles will protect your
04:44
eyes against chemicals and flying
04:46
particles if you normally wear
04:50
spectacles and you need to protect your
04:52
eyes wear goggles over the top of your
04:55
spectacles

[Music]
05:49
every tool is designed for a special
05:52
purpose sharp tools should be directed
05:56
away from the body not towards it to
05:59
avoid injury if the tool or the
06:01
workpiece slips
06:05
using the wrong tool or using the right
06:08
one incorrectly can cause injury as well
06:11
as spoiling the work already done
06:15
incorrect use of tools is a frequent
06:18
cause of accidents
06:25
stow your tools away when you've
06:27
finished with them to reduce the dangers
06:29
posed by sharp cutting edges always use
06:34
the correct tool for the job in hand
06:40
when using power tools machinery and
06:43
watertight doors
06:44
observe all the safety signs and
06:47
instructions if a machine is designed to
06:51
be used with a safety guard make sure it
06:53
is properly in place if there is a
06:56
problem with the safety guard don't use
06:58
the machine until it has been rectified
07:04
clothes and equipment can be caught up
07:07
in moving machinery
07:13
electric shock and burns are a risk to
07:16
the careless and unwary if there is any
07:19
apparent damage to electrical cables or
07:22
plugs don't use them report them for
07:25
repair
07:26
keep leads short and arranged to prevent
07:30
them being chapped or cut during use
07:35
faulty electrical fittings and cables
07:38
can also cause fire do not use faulty
07:41
equipment and do not exceed the rated
07:44
load when using electrical tools report
07:48
any items in a dangerous condition
07:52
electrical tools and lights should be
07:55
isolated from the mains when not in use
08:04
make sure you are familiar with the
08:07
first-aid procedures relating to
08:09
electric shock
08:24
if a machine becomes defective the power
08:27
supply should be locked off and a
08:29
warning noticed posted
08:34
only a qualified person should carry out
08:37
electrical repairs the threat of fire
08:43
onboard ship is ever-present whatever
08:47
measures are taken or safety features
08:49
installed there is still the risk of
08:51
carelessness or neglect
08:54
whichever task you are performing good
08:57
housekeeping and cleanliness are crucial
09:00
in preventing fires combustible
09:03
materials should be disposed off or
09:05
stored safely
09:13
a ship's engine room contains all the
09:16
necessary ingredients for a fire unsafe
09:19
working practices therefore can add to
09:21
the risk of an engine room fire take
09:26
care when using flammable materials near
09:29
exhaust pipes or hot surfaces fuel leaks
09:33
and grease should be cleaned up
09:35
immediately remove all oil soaked
09:39
slagging as soon as possible and change
09:42
oily clothing to avoid the risk of fire
09:45
always change into clean overalls when
09:48
necessary always follow the proper
09:52
notification procedures if you are alone
09:54
in the engine room know the meaning of
10:01
alarm signals and the location of safety
10:04
equipment in the engine room pre plan
10:08
your escape in the event of a fire
10:10
pre-planned several routes in case one
10:13
escape route gets blocked by fire or
10:15
smoke
10:16
remember that smoke is a bigger killer
10:19
than flame in a smoke-filled room the
10:23
air near of the floor is generally
10:25
clearer so crawl on your hands and knees
10:27
if you have to evacuate the engine room
10:32
immediately on hearing the fire alarm to
10:35
allow the use of co2 installations when
10:41
welding or flame cutting the utmost care
10:44
must be exercised always arrange to have
10:48
a fire watch when welding this type of
10:52
work requires extensive training if you
10:56
are not certified or trained to use
10:58
welding and flame cutting equipment
11:00
don't use them
11:04
filters cut out these dangerous rays
11:07
minor oil leaks or spills often occur in
11:11
the engine room slips and falls are
11:15
among the most common types of accident
11:17
on board ship so watch your step
11:20
especially when carrying things use
11:23
handrails when they are there oil spills
11:28
need cleaning up immediately and the
11:31
source of any leak rectified protect
11:34
your hands by wearing gloves
11:40
remember that oily waste can ignite
11:43
spontaneously so store it in a
11:46
designated metal container with a lid
11:49
oily waste should be stored away from
11:52
heat and disposed off in the correct way
11:57
all traces of oil should be washed from
12:00
your skin straight away skin exposed to
12:04
mineral oils can develop dermatitis and
12:06
in extreme cases even cancer barrier
12:11
creams help to protect your skin and
12:13
make it easier to clean next time
12:18
hazardous materials can be found aboard
12:21
any ship
12:25
even the ship's fuel can contain benzene
12:28
and other chemicals with which you need
12:30
to avoid contact
12:34
[Music]
13:25
take care when staring and handling
13:28
chemicals and compressed gases the
13:31
material safety data sheets held on
13:33
board lists the safe handling procedures
13:36
for these items
13:42
incorrectly stowed heavy engine room
13:44
spares are a major cause of injury store
13:48
all heavy spares securely use the
13:51
correct lifting techniques when handling
13:53
heavy components Good Housekeeping is an
13:57
important part of working safely and is
13:59
everyone's responsibility if four plates
14:03
have been temporarily removed the
14:06
openings should be protected warning
14:09
notices should be posted where they can
14:11
be seen at all times until it is safe to
14:13
remove them
14:17
missing floor plates are dangerous
14:20
replace them as soon as possible
14:23
if lifting handles are not available use
14:26
a sensible lever not your fingers avoid
14:32
tiredness by having sufficient sleep and
14:35
rest periods drinking plenty of liquids
14:38
will counter the effects of dehydration
