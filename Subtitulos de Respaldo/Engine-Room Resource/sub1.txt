the International Maritime Organization
00:12
IMO has newly introduced requirements
00:16
for engine room resource management
00:18
erm into the competence of marine
00:21
engineer officers under the 2010 manila
00:24
amendments this DVD was produced to
00:31
allow people to learn what erm is what
00:34
erm principles are and what should be
00:37
understood
00:44
[Music]
00:49
recent analyses of marine casualties
00:52
indicated that many of the fundamental
00:54
elements of bridge resource management
00:56
BRM and engine-room resource management
00:59
erm
01:00
were not being practiced in addition it
01:05
was also clearly evident that a lack of
01:08
communication was a prominent factor in
01:10
marine casualties in this context IMO
01:14
reached a conclusion that it was
01:16
imperative to include the non-technical
01:18
skills such as BRM and erm in the STCW
01:23
code as requirements for deckhand
01:26
engineer officers in order to prevent
01:28
maritime incidents erm is an approach to
01:35
achieve a safe navigation by
01:38
appropriately managing the resources of
01:40
personnel equipment and information in
01:43
the machinery space and by effectively
01:45
utilizing them namely management of
01:51
resources includes personnel management
01:53
equipment management and information
01:56
management
02:00
erm requirements are stipulated in the
02:03
competence table a - 3/1 as shown on the
02:08
display as requirements for the
02:10
competence maintain a safe engineering
02:12
watch at the operational level that is
02:15
knowledge of erm principles including
02:18
these five requirements as knowledge
02:20
understanding and proficiency
02:25
[Music]
02:30
erm principles are fundamental elements
02:34
in erm and particularly regarding
02:36
necessary erm principles to maintain a
02:39
watch nine principles such as proper
02:42
arrangements of personnel consideration
02:45
of qualification limit and appropriate
02:47
communication are stipulated in Section
02:49
a of chapter 8 of the STCW code
02:53
providing how to arrange personnel
02:55
personnel competency required a code of
02:59
conduct and others now let's briefly
03:06
explain constituent elements of erm
03:09
based on the provisions
03:13
first with regard to resources personnel
03:17
means human resources allocated for a
03:19
safe navigation and are required to have
03:22
competency to manage and utilize other
03:25
personnel as well as appropriate
03:27
qualification in performing tasks in
03:31
addition personnel are required to be
03:34
well versed in the functions of
03:35
equipment and to have capability to
03:38
utilize information from the equipment
03:40
and to confirm the functions are being
03:42
demonstrated equipment as resource means
03:48
all installations to maintain a safe
03:50
navigation and they should be fully
03:52
functional information resource means
03:59
information comes from external
04:01
personnel running and maintenance
04:03
records drawings instruction manuals and
04:06
equipment there are two types of
04:09
information from the equipment which are
04:11
the information that automatically comes
04:13
from equipment like a monitoring system
04:15
and the information detected by
04:17
personnel using their five senses
04:20
[Music]
04:25
allocation and assignment of resources
04:28
says that appropriate personnel should
04:30
be allocated properly and in particular
04:32
it becomes more important when entering
04:35
or leaving ports due to the need to
04:37
establish an adequate command system and
04:40
to handle propulsion machinery more
04:42
accurately personnel are required to
04:49
prioritize various duties considering
04:51
their judgements on safety urgency and
04:54
adequacy in accordance with situations
04:59
[Music]
05:03
communication is an information exchange
05:06
necessary for maintaining safe
05:08
navigation in this information exchange
05:11
there are forms of order response
05:13
provision of information and report
05:16
according to the operational aspects and
05:18
effective communication means that this
05:21
information exchange is being fully
05:23
carried out before each communication
05:29
the rank personality and awareness of
05:32
personnel could be reflected upon to
05:34
determine how much information exchange
05:36
is necessary and it can be said that a
05:39
lack of communication is largely caused
05:41
by the attitude of both sides personnel
05:46
therefore should be mindful of the
05:48
following communication issues I had no
05:53
report the idea that I could not receive
05:57
the expected report due to a negligence
05:59
of the person who should report it no
06:06
one is aware of it
06:07
the idea that unawareness of information
06:10
or situation that I was already aware of
06:13
must be caused by a lack of ability of
06:15
the person who should be aware of it I
06:19
have not heard of it the idea that the
06:23
delay of information to be
06:24
preferentially informed must be caused
06:27
by the person who should be distributing
06:29
it not understanding the meaning of
06:31
prompt distribution of information it
06:35
has already been realized you are
06:38
obsessed with an idea that has already
06:40
been realized without the information
06:42
being reported or provided I didn't say
06:47
it since I was not asked the idea that I
06:50
don't need to advise people of the
06:52
information I have unless I am
06:54
specifically asked of it it is often
07:00
necessary for personnel to be assertive
07:03
within the workplace for maintaining
07:04
safe navigation without any hesitation
07:07
notwithstanding their position and
07:09
hierarchical relationship
07:12
furthermore junior personnel sometimes
07:15
have to be assertive in asking for
07:17
clarification of decisions made by their
07:20
superiors if the reasons for those
07:22
decisions are not clear and if he or she
07:25
considers that these decisions might
07:27
adversely affect the safe navigation
07:30
assertiveness is a behavior that meets
07:33
the element of notify any doubt in BRM
07:36
erm principles and is therefore an
07:38
inherent element of BRM erm leadership
07:48
is an essential human element in
07:50
practicing erm and requires an ability
07:53
to lead understanding influence to other
07:56
personnel and how to motivate them
08:04
situational awareness is an ability to
08:07
assess accurately the existence of risks
08:10
the possibility of environmental
08:12
pollution illegal situations and the
08:15
likelihood of incidents in various
08:17
situations
08:24
consideration of team experience is to
08:26
take experiences of all members of the
08:29
team including junior personnel into
08:31
account and to utilize the experiences
08:34
in order to achieve safe navigation and
08:36
watchkeeping now let's watch the scene
08:43
of a ship entering a port this ship is a
08:49
10,000 gross tonne class RORO ship when
08:52
entering and leaving port main engine
08:55
maneuvering is carried out from the
08:56
control room and a direct telephone line
08:59
is used for communication between the
09:01
bridge and the control room in addition
09:03
to the engine Telegraph
09:08
[Music]
09:09
in order to ensure sharing information
09:12
an engine room command communication
09:15
system is used for communication between
09:17
the engine control room and the engine
09:19
room so that personnel in the engine
09:21
room can listen to information issued
09:24
from the control room through
09:25
loudspeakers and personnel in the engine
09:28
control room can listen to information
09:29
issued from the engine room
09:31
through a speaker the second engineer
09:38
who was checking the unmanned machinery
09:40
in the control room received a phone
09:42
call from the bridge saying that there
09:44
was 25 miles left to the pilot station
09:47
the second engineer immediately reported
09:50
the information from the bridge to the
09:52
chief engineer and having received the
09:54
chief engineer's instruction he informed
09:57
the first engineer the third engineer
09:59
and the engine crew members who should
10:01
be standing by after that the second
10:06
engineer changed the control mode from
10:08
unmanned to manned and the control
10:11
position of the main engine from the
10:12
bridge to the control room and began
10:15
preparations for entering the port
10:17
starting reduction of main engine speed
10:20
