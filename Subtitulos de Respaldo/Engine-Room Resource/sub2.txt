00:11
fifteen miles left to the pilot station
00:14
all right 15 miles left to the pilot
00:17
station 15 miles to the pilot station
00:24
number 2 generator is about to be
00:26
started from control room report the
00:27
running condition
00:29
[Music]
00:32
all right 15 miles to the pilot station
00:34
number two generator it is about to be
00:36
started from control room let's go
00:40
[Music]
00:49
I'm starting number two generator
00:52
[Music]
01:18
[Music]
01:37
exhaust gas temperature of number one
01:40
cylinder is rising a bit faster it would
01:43
be settled down in a short while I am
01:47
putting steering motors into parallel
01:48
running
01:49
all right beginning parallel running of
01:51
steering motors
02:01
steering motors are now running in
02:03
parallel report the running condition
02:10
all right steering motors are now
02:12
running in parallel number two generator
02:14
seems to be okay
02:19
number one do me a favor
02:24
check the steering gear please okay I
02:28
will
02:31
alright number two generator is in good
02:34
order I am starting parallel running of
02:36
number one and two generators I'm
02:41
putting number one and two generators
02:43
into parallel running parallel running
02:56
of number one and two generators started
02:58
alright beginning parallel running of
03:00
number one in two generators
03:18
[Music]
03:32
start number two main air compressor and
03:34
start parallel running of main air
03:36
compressors
03:42
yes certainly I will start parallel
03:44
running of main air compressors
03:51
start number two main air compressor and
03:53
start pelo running please and make sure
03:55
you operate the magnetic drain valves
03:56
just in case yes I will
04:25
third engineer there was no problem with
04:28
the parallel running of the steering
04:30
motors all right thank you there was no
04:35
problem with the parallel running of
04:36
steering motors all right there was no
04:39
problem with the parallel running of
04:40
steering motors there is no problem with
04:47
the parallel running of steering motors
04:49
yes thank you for the report
04:53
third engineer I have started the
04:56
parallel running of main air compressors
04:58
and they're in good order all right
05:00
thank you the parallel running of main
05:06
air compressors has been started in good
05:08
order sir
05:09
all right the parallel running of main
05:11
air compressors has been started in good
05:13
order its exhaust gas high temperature
05:25
alarm of number one cylinder on number
05:26
two generator engine room check the
05:28
generator and report the situation
05:40
[Applause]
05:52
it seems not to be a sensor problem the
05:56
fuel injection valve must be faulty the
05:59
temperature seems to soar just after the
06:01
load running was started I wonder why
06:02
there was no sign of this at the time of
06:04
starting nothing was reported like that
06:06
I will ask him if there was any sign of
06:08
it later
06:32
the temperature of number one cylinder
06:35
was 350 and 50 degrees higher than any
06:39
other cylinder no problem found other
06:42
than that sir all right chief engineer
06:46
let's start number three generator
06:48
immediately for parallel running of
06:49
number one and three generator yes go
06:52
ahead I am starting number three
06:55
generator report running condition I
06:57
will disconnect number two generator to
06:59
make single running of number one
07:01
generator all right number three
07:05
generator is about to be started and
07:06
number two generator is being
07:08
disconnected I am starting number three
07:14
generator
07:53
five miles left to the pilot station
07:56
alright five miles to the pilot station
08:03
five miles to the pilot station
08:08
all right five miles to the pilot
08:10
station all looks good with number three
08:12
generator all right all looks good with
08:15
number three generator after putting
08:17
number one and three generators into
08:19
parallel running I will switch on the
08:20
bath Ruster and deck machinery
08:39
all right starting parallel running of
08:41
number one in three generators and
08:43
switch on the bow thruster and deck
08:46
machinery speed reduction of the main
08:52
engine completed okay I will inform the
08:54
bridge we have about one hour left to
08:57
approach the berth stop number two
09:00
generator at the engine side and replace
09:02
fuel injection valve of number one
09:03
cylinder
09:06
[Music]
09:17
I think standby engine will come soon
09:20
and so I would like to avoid the work of
09:22
replacing the fuel injection valve
09:24
during the standby period two persons
09:26
will be unavailable for standby and if
09:29
something urgent happens it will be more
09:31
difficult to address the situation
09:33
besides if we started working on number
09:35
two generator now it would be
09:37
unavailable for use in an emergency
09:40
first engineer we should respect their
09:45
decision and we would be better to avoid
09:49
any additional work during Stannah so we
09:54
have enough personnel available for any
09:57
other urgent situations
09:59
[Music]
10:01
yes I understood engine room stop number
10:06
two generator at the engine side as
10:08
usual and make it stand by condition
10:15
understood I will stop number two
10:17
generator and prepare for standby
10:24
mr. Yamamoto go and check the
10:27
temperature please okay I will
10:43
reduction of main engine speed seemed to
10:46
be completed was there a report of
10:48
preparations for standby engine there
10:50
are only three miles to the pilot
10:52
station not yet sir
10:55
I guess that is coming soon
11:02
[Music]
11:08
the exhaust gas temperature of main
11:10
engine has dropped below 200 the damper
11:13
of the exhaust gas economizer is still
11:15
open who was aware of that I wasn't
11:19
sorry I missed it
11:20
I'll close it now closing the damper of
11:24
exhaust gas economizer alright the
11:30
damper of exhaust gas economizers about
11:32
to be closed
11:36
the exhaust gas temperature has dropped
11:38
I see thank you I will stop number two
11:42
generator as the exhaust gas
11:44
temperatures drop alright stop number
11:49
two generator
11:52
[Applause]
12:19
there has been no report of preparation
12:21
for standby engine did something happen
12:24
I guess they missed it I will ask the
12:27
control room
12:38
we will soon be three miles from the
12:40
pilot station its standby engine
12:43
possible certainly I missed the report
12:45
for trouble of number two generator
12:46
standby engine is now available
12:49
I have already switched on the bow
12:50
thruster and the deck machinery thank
12:53
you for that I will report it to the
12:54
captain captain standby engine is now
12:59
available electric power for the bow
13:01
thruster and deck machinery is already
13:03
available all right
13:04
standby engine standby engine chief
13:09
engineer standby engine is requested
13:11
okay I'll respond
13:14
[Music]
13:17
standby engine standby engine standby
13:20
engine sir slower down engine now let's
13:26
review the scene of entering port in
13:28
terms of engine room resource management
13:31
first of all regarding personnel
13:34
arrangement personnel were allocated in
13:36
the engine control room and the engine
13:38
room and it can be said this was
13:41
satisfactory considering the rules of
13:43
each person in addition it is important
13:46
that the third engineer was likely
13:48
standing at the position where he could
13:50
quickly contact the control room
13:53
regarding the communication there were
13:55
three lessons the third engineer was
13:58
aware of the rapid rising of the exhaust
14:01
gas temperature of number one cylinder
14:03
when number two generator was started
14:05
but he didn't report it to the control
14:07
room this means that the information
14:10
detected by five senses from equipment
14:12
was not shared
14:18
if it had been shared personnel in the
14:21
control room could have paid attention
14:23
to the temperature and could have
14:24
addressed the situation before the alarm
14:26
sounded it is necessary to communicate
14:29
to the team leader anything that was
14:31
felt to be wrong the chief engineer said
14:39
impatiently that the damper of exhaust
14:42
gas economizer had not been closed this
14:45
behavior is like a rebuke and is likely
14:48
to inhibit further communication in this
14:50
case the chief engineer should have only
14:53
said to close the damper as a member of
14:55
the team the second engineer tried to
15:02
inform the bridge of completion of
15:03
preparation for standby engine when he
15:06
completed reduction of main engine
15:07
revolution however he forgot to do this
15:10
being absorbed in the order to the
15:12
engine room issued by the first engineer
15:16
there was a question from the bridge for
15:19
the delay of notifying completion of
15:21
preparation for standby engine if there
15:24
had been no question embarkation of the
15:26
pilot could be obstructed when any doubt
15:29
exists about a situation it is essential
15:32
to make an inquiry in order to clarify
15:34
the situation regardless of the rank of
15:37
the person you are asking the third
15:41
engineer asserted his judgment as the
15:43
leader of the station against the order
15:45
to replace the fuel injection valve of
15:47
number two generator during standby
15:49
engine this means assertiveness and
15:54
meeting notify any doubt in the ERM
15:57
principals the decision to make
15:59
retaining the engine on standby the top
16:02
priority was correct in terms of
16:03
situational awareness and prioritization
16:10
now let's continue to watch the scene of
16:14
entering the port
