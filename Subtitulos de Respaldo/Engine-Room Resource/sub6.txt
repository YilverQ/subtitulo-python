00:04
we have one mile left to the harbor
00:06
limit finished using bow thruster and
00:08
deck machinery alright one mile to the
00:12
harbour limit finished using bow
00:13
thruster and deck machinery
00:20
one miles to the harbor limit finished
00:23
using bow thruster and deck machinery
00:24
both now switched off
00:45
alright one mile to the harbour limit
00:47
finished using bow thruster and deck
00:49
machinery and no problem found with the
00:51
replaced bearing of number one main
00:52
cooling sea water pump and running
00:54
condition of number one ello Pyrrha
00:55
fires in good order alright but too
01:00
early to make a judgment on the running
01:01
condition since only 15 minutes has
01:03
passed after changing the pump to number
01:05
one
01:05
pay attention continuously to the
01:07
bearings yes certainly
01:12
first engineer we cannot find anything
01:16
about the running sound of the bearings
01:18
and the vibration of elbow purifier on
01:20
the monitor having done the maintenance
01:22
works the third engineer reported it
01:24
that was good of them yes I think so
01:37
half a head engine have a head engine
01:44
opening the damper of exhaust gas
01:46
economizer all right the damper of
01:49
exhaust gas economizer is opening
02:09
damper okay alright I have confirmed the
02:15
damper opened and that the bypass was
02:18
closed all right
02:30
as far as I can monitor the fuel
02:32
injection valves of the main engine are
02:34
good yes number one would report to us
02:37
if something was wrong as he is watching
02:39
the valves
02:40
I'll ask him in any case report if
02:44
something's wrong like an oil or gas
02:45
leak from number one and three cylinder
02:47
fuel valves on the main engine
03:05
no problem all right
03:12
no oil leak gas leak or any other
03:15
problem found all right
03:27
for my head engine full ahead engine
03:35
first engineer is it okay to start the
03:38
ejector pump in preparation for starting
03:40
the freshwater generator all right start
03:45
the ejector pump thank you I will
03:53
mr. Sato let's start the pump all right
04:13
third engineer I have started the
04:15
ejector pump started ejector pump in
04:20
addition no problem found with the motor
04:21
bearing condition of number one main
04:23
cooling sea water pump
04:26
all right stop automatic combustion
04:28
equipment of auxilary boiler alright I
04:34
will stop the combustion equipment
04:40
[Music]
04:55
full away engine will soon be ordered
04:58
put steering motors two single running
05:00
all right full away engine will be soon
05:03
steering motors two single running full
05:06
away engine will be soon
05:07
steering motors two single running pull
05:11
away engine full away engine I am making
05:21
number one generator single running put
05:23
main air compressors into single running
05:27
number one generator is now single
05:29
running stop number two generator at the
05:32
engine side looking at the exhaust gas
05:33
temperatures alright main air compressor
05:36
is single running I will stop number two
05:38
generator accordingly stop the
05:40
combustion equipment of auxilary boiler
05:46
alright the auxilary boiler stopped
05:56
I put Maine air compressors into number
06:01
one single running all right number one
06:04
main air compressor is single running
06:38
I stopped number two generator and
06:40
completed the preparation for standby
06:41
chief engineer can we start usual watch
06:44
shift okay all right engine room station
06:49
number two generator is about to be set
06:50
to first standby I am setting number two
06:56
generator to first standby
07:03
subsequent procedures will be done by
07:05
the watch personnel today we have manned
07:07
watch shift dismissed
07:19
no problem with the machinery
07:25
as 15 knots is planned for this voyage
07:28
we should set revolution speed to 130
07:30
revolutions per minute and blade angle
07:33
to 20 degrees yes sir third engineer
07:36
takes over I will have a good look
07:38
around while increasing the engine speed
07:51
are you okay thanks for takeover
08:42
there's a little accumulation of fuel
08:45
oil in the fuel oil leakage pan
09:05
yes chief engineer this is third
09:07
engineer I found accumulation of fuel
09:10
oil in the fuel oil leakage pan of
09:11
number three cylinder on the main engine
09:13
so far there's been no oil leak like
09:15
this so it's probably from its high
09:16
pressure of fuel pipes the fitting of
09:20
the high-pressure fuel pipes was likely
09:21
not good since it's unlikely that the
09:23
high-pressure fuel pipe is broken make
09:25
sure that there is no oil leak falling
09:27
on the surface of an exhaust gas pipe or
09:29
any other high-temperature surface such
09:30
as a cylinder head there was an incident
09:33
where leaking oil fell on the exhaust
09:34
manifold resulting in an engine room
09:36
fire when I looked around there was no
09:39
oil leak like that okay so I will come
09:43
to the control room and you can confirm
09:45
whether the leak is from four or aft I
09:47
will communicate to first engineer and
09:49
you communicate to the bridge telling
09:51
them the situation and that there is a
09:53
possibility that we may need to stop the
09:56
main engine yes understood
10:09
this is the third engineer on duty
10:11
I found an oil leak from the fuel
10:13
injection valves on the main engine I
10:14
will confirm from which valve the oil
10:16
leak is coming so we may need to stop
10:17
the main engine according to the
10:19
circumstances all right I will report it
10:22
to captain first I will make sure
10:29
whether the leak is from four or aft of
10:31
number three cylinder I think I can
10:33
determine where the leak is coming from
10:35
looking at the oil pan carefully mr.
10:37
Sato you stay here in the control room
10:39
as someone may call us okay probably you
10:43
can see a marking by looking at the
10:45
surface of each pipe
11:14
it must be the aft high-pressure fuel
11:17
pipe
11:26
it's the apt side high pressure pipe I
11:28
found oil drops from the pipe as engine
11:33
load Rises oil leak will increase it
11:36
will be better to stop the main engine
11:38
rather than cutting the fuel oil to
11:39
number three cylinder yes I think so too
11:42
it's not too late to stop the main
11:44
engine soon maybe it would be okay if we
11:46
remove the pipe and refit it to number
11:47
three cylinder then let's do that I will
11:51
talk to captain this is chief engineer
11:59
can I speak to captain please hold the
12:01
line for a moment
12:08
yes speaking there is oil leak from the
12:12
aft high-pressure fuel pipe of number
12:14
three cylinder on the main engine it's
12:17
only a small leak at the moment but it
12:18
will likely increase from now on I would
12:20
like to stop the main engine and refit
12:22
the high-pressure pipe is that possible
12:23
we are now in the fairway so we will go
12:27
another one-mile leaving the route and
12:29
make for a temporary Anchorage how many
12:31
hours will it take to complete the work
12:33
about half an hour after stopping the
12:35
main engine alright I will alter the
12:38
course now you have watched the scene of
12:45
getting to full away on passage from the
12:47
situation approaching the harbour limit
12:49
after having left the port full away
12:52
engine was ordered and the ship was at
12:55
full away on passage but the ship was
12:57
temporarily anchored after going ahead
12:59
one mile due to the oil leak from the
13:02
fuel oil high pressure pipe of the
13:04
replaced feel oil injection valve the
13:08
oil leak was found by the third engineer
13:10
while on engine room rounds the leaked
13:13
oil goes to the leaked oil tank from the
13:15
oil pan and an alarm will sound when the
13:18
leaked oil level rises to a certain
13:20
level however the ship must be under way
13:25
at full Away speed when the alarm sounds
13:28
therefore it took a longer time to stop
13:31
the main engine in the engine room there
13:34
is a lot of information from the
13:35
machinery that we cannot get from the
13:37
monitoring systems in the control room
13:39
it is very important to find the
13:42
information and to address a situation
13:44
before an alarm sounds for this reason
13:47
you can easily understand that engine
13:49
room rounds are essential
13:54
[Music]
13:56
now the third engineer turned his
13:59
attention to the renewed motor bearings
14:01
of number one main cooling sea water
14:04
pump and the ellow purifier on which
14:07
periodical maintenance had been done
14:12
regarding the running condition of the
14:14
bearings the first engineer stated that
14:16
only fifteen minutes running was too
14:18
short to judge if it was running okay
14:21
responding to the third engineer's
14:23
report it would have been better if he
14:27
had justified his report thereby sharing
14:30
information and maintaining effective
14:32
communication in addition the third
14:40
engineer decided to start the ejector
14:42
pump for the freshwater generator early
14:44
in preparation for sea passage he made
14:47
this decision because he knew that it
14:50
took a long time to establish a vacuum
14:52
inside the freshwater generator this
14:55
decision represents his proper
14:57
prioritization next regarding the phone
15:02
call from the third engineer reporting
15:04
oil leak the chief engineer made sure
15:07
that there was no oil leak on the
15:09
exhaust pipes and around the cylinder
15:11
heads of the main engine making
15:13
reference to a previous incident of oil
15:15
leaking onto a hot surface that led to
15:17
an engine room fire it is very
15:20
convincing and effective that the chief
15:22
engineer explains things by using his
15:25
experience or knowledge and information
15:27
to foster the skills of correct
15:29
prioritization of resources and
15:31
maintaining situational awareness within
15:34
his team members so let's explain the
15:39
incident which the chief engineer used
15:41
as an example it was caused by oil
15:44
leaking from around a nipple of a fuel
15:46
oil pipe that was broken because of
15:48
vibration the oil fell onto the surface
15:51
of a hot exhaust pipe and started a fire
15:53
which then spread throughout the engine
15:55
room in this case two issues were
15:59
pointed out as problem areas one was
16:02
that although the watch engineer found
16:04
the oil leak around the crankcase of the
16:06
main engine he didn't inform the chief
16:09
engineer of it immediately and the other
16:11
was that although the chief engineer was
16:14
informed of the oil leak by the watch
16:16
officer on the bridge he didn't issue
16:18
appropriate instructions such as
16:20
stopping the f-o booster pump thinking
16:23
that the watch engineer was familiar
16:25
with handling the main engine the scene
16:30
you had watched so far was slightly
16:32
different from actual situations but the
16:35
exchanges of information between the
16:37
bridge and the control room were
16:39
considered to be the minimum extent of
16:42
communication when practicing erm the
16:47
information was transmitted to the
16:49
engine room and all the personnel could
16:52
become fully aware of the ship situation
16:54
such information enables all personnel
16:58
in the engine room to work as a team
17:00
when an operating machinery and to
17:02
maintain their motivation
