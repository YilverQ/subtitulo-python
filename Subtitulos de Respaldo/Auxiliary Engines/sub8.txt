Control and safety system the engine transmitters send signals for the alarm
00:26
and monitoring system via the junction box on these signals may be observed
00:33
while the engine is running thereby making it easier to monitor the
00:38
operation of the engine in addition to these transmitters the engine is
00:43
equipped with numerous manometers and thermometers which should be logged at a
00:48
daily basis and compared to the values observed on the alarm and monitoring
00:53
system if the signals monitored by the alarm and monitoring system that outside
00:59
the preset intervals the system would trigger an alarm transmitters and
01:05
switches on the engine send signals of a safety system which will result in an
01:11
engine shutdown if the values are outside the preset interval to overspeed
01:17
trips are fitted to the engine one mechanical and one electropneumatic the
01:24
mechanic overspeed trip is triggered by a spring-loaded weight on the camshaft
01:29
while the electric pneumatic is triggered by an electrical signal
01:34
transmitted by the tackle relay
