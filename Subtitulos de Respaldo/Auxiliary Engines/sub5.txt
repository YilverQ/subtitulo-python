General information learning objectives the objectives of this section are to
00:07
make operational personnel acquainted with engine type designation technical
00:14
data
00:35
there are four special graphics which should be clicked whenever you see them
00:40
during this module points of importance regarding operation and maintenance this
00:47
is used as an indication of danger for life health or extensive damages to
00:53
engine and other equipment is used to point out specifically important details
01:00
or variations that should be noticed the following documentation is delivered
01:06
with Alstyne beragon engines operating manual describes the day-to-day
01:12
operation and maintenance of the engine service manual contains technical
01:20
specifications and descriptions of extensive maintenance work sundry
01:26
instructions contains the documentation from our subcontractors electronic
01:34
interactive documentation all intervals for maintenance given amend as a
01:41
guidance only and depends upon the operating conditions the flywheel end of
01:47
the engine is where the flywheel is fitted the opposite end is called the
01:51
free end or the pump end the manoeuvre side of the engine is the longitudinal
01:57
side where the control panel is fitted this is the same side as the fuel oil
02:04
injection pumps located the opposite side is called the exhaust side the
02:11
designation of the cylinders on illest and Berrigan engines begins from the
02:16
pump end the cylinder closest to the pump end will be number 1 and then the
02:23
numbers will increase towards the flywheel end the direction of rotation
02:29
of the old sign beragon engines is per definition as seen from flywheel end
02:48
all standard inline engines from ill Steenburgen are rotating anti-clockwise
