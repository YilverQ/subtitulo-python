The charge air and exhaust system during operation or just after the engine has
00:26
been stopped most of the engine will be hot touching the engine parts may cause
00:32
burns in this system be especially aware of the following parts the turbocharger
00:39
and connecting piping will get extremely hot the charge air receiver may reach 70
00:45
degrees Celsius the exhaust system will get extremely hot even though the
00:51
exhaust manifold is well insulated flanges especially close to the
00:57
turbocharger may cause severe burns
01:02
charge airs drawn through the compressor side of the turbocharger and continues
01:07
to the charge air cooler fitted beneath the turbocharger after the charge air
01:13
cooler the flow goes through the charged air manifold from the manifold the air
01:20
is distributed to each cylinder after combustion the exhaust valves open to
01:27
the exhaust manifold the manifold leads the exhaust flow back to the
01:33
turbocharger what it drives the turbine rotor thereafter it is carried through
01:39
possible heat exchangers and silencers to the atmosphere look for any leakages
01:46
tighten and change seals if necessary when operating on heavy fuel oil the
01:53
exhaust temperature will increase somewhat due to the slower combustion of
01:58
that type of fuel an increase of approximately 10 to 20 degrees Celsius
02:03
over diesel oil operation is normal it is important that the values from these
02:09
instruments are checked and recorded every day according to the log sheet to
02:15
assure that the operating staff will notice significant changes click the
02:20
components for further information the exhaust gas from the engine drives the
02:27
turbine which drives the compressor the compressor unit sucks in and
02:32
compresses the air required for the engine click the text the compressor
02:39
side of the turbocharger should be washed daily this should be carried out
02:44
at no less than 75% engine load remove the screw on the top of the tank fill
02:52
0.4 liters water into the water tank
03:09
tighten the screw actuate the valve towards the spring and hold it for about
03:14
10 seconds until all water's been injected engines running on heavy fuel
03:21
oil should have the turbochargers turbine washed once a week
04:06
run the engine a marine diesel oil during the water washing open the drain
04:12
cock and ensure that hot exhaust is coming out of the drain Pike if not
04:17
clear the blockage
04:30
adjust charge air pressure to 0.3 bar by reducing engine load run for five
04:38
minutes before washing
04:52
connect cold water supply from the ships freshwater system to the water pressure
04:57
regulator connection open the water injection valves before carefully
05:05
opening the water to the hose
05:24
check water pressure if necessary adjust 1 plus minus 0.2 bar
05:38
cleaning should go on for 10 minutes only water vapor and some drops of water
05:43
will come out of the drain cock
06:02
shut up water to the holes and close the water injection valves disconnect the
06:08
hose
06:20
run the engine at same load for five minutes to dry up the turbine then shut
06:27
the drain cock
06:39
increase engine load to normal for evaporating of condensed water the
06:45
compressor side of the turbocharger check oil level once a day the oil level
06:54
should be inside the red circle while it stands still
07:06
if check oil level once a day the oil level
07:13
should be inside the red circle while it stands still if the color of the lube
07:19
oil has turned significantly darker than it was the day before there is a
07:25
possibility for seriously damaging the turbocharger increased foaming in the
07:31
oil gauge glass is an indication that the oil should be changed remember both
07:38
bearings have their own oil reservoir the turbocharger must not run when oil
07:44
is being changed open the drain plug and the filling plug on the bearing housing
07:50
cover and drain the used oil fast in the drain plug fill the lubricating oil up
08:02
to the upper mark on the sight glass
08:10
place the gasket on the filling plug and fasten it thoroughly remember both
08:17
bearings have their own oil reservoir
08:22
generally we recommend a synthetic lubricating oil which should be changed
08:27
at least once per 5000 operational hour when refilling oil follow the same
08:34
procedure as when changing oil except from opening drain plug remember both
08:42
bearings have their own oil reservoir the main purpose of the charge air
08:47
cooler is to reduce the temperature of the charged air engines running on heavy
08:54
fuel oil are always fitted with two-stage coolers Stage one is connected
09:02
into the engines jacket water circuit while Stage two is cooled by seawater or
09:09
low temperature freshwater the heat from the jacket water is used to heat the
09:16
charged air at low engine load to stage air coolers are fitted with drain
09:25
channels to ensure detection of leakages if water leakage water will come out of
09:32
the telltale hole air leakage can be detected by whistling sound in case of
09:41
water or air leakage the end cover gasket has to be replaced if a sea water
09:49
cooling system is used the end covers should be disassembled at regular
09:54
intervals for inspection and cleaning when out of service for longer periods
10:01
drain and leave drain and venting cocks open if using sea water cooling flush
10:09
with fresh water
10:23
the insulation screen must always be in place when the engine is running because
10:29
the exhaust manifold is hot and contact may cause fire or burning accidents
