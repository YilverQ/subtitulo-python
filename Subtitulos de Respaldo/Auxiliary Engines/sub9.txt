The governing system upon a start signal from the ship's auxiliary engine control
00:27
system starting Ayers led to the engine the tacho relay receives a signal from a
00:34
magnetic pickup on the flywheel cover which indicates the engine's speed when
00:42
the speed exceeds 300 rpm the tacho relay sends a signal to the speed
00:47
controller indicating the engine is running and the starting air is shut off
00:53
the speed controller receives a speed signal from a magnetic pickup on the
00:59
flywheel cover while the engine speed is below normal running speed it sends
01:05
signals to the actuator fitted on the flywheel end of the engine to increase
01:11
engine speed the actuator transforms the electric signals to mechanical movement
01:18
and through arms and linkages it changes the admission of the fuel oil injection
01:24
pumps in multi engine systems when the engine receives normal running speed the
01:32
synchronizer starts comparing frequency phases and voltage on the net side with
01:39
the corresponding values on the generator side when they are equal the
01:45
synchronizer closes the circuit generator breaker and the generator set
01:49
is connected to the bus the synchronizer is automatically switched off afterwards
01:58
when the circuit generator brake is closed the speed controller receives
02:04
signals indicating the load of the engine from the sensors in a switch gear
02:08
and signals showing the load of the other auxilary engines in the vessel if
02:14
the load of the engine diverges from the wanted load compared to the other
02:19
engines the speed controller changes the signal to the actuator to change the
02:25
admission on the engine when a change in the load and the main
02:30
bests occurs the generator will be forced to increase its output since the
02:36
engine speed is constant determined by the frequency on the main bus the
02:42
increased load from the generator results in an automatically increased
02:46
power output from the engine by increasing the admission click the
02:53
component for further information the electro hydraulic actuator is fitted on
03:01
the flywheel end of the engine the actuator receives electric signals from
03:05
the speed controller which it transforms to mechanical movement through arms and
03:13
linkages the actuator alters the admission to the fuel injection pumps
03:18
thus regulating the output from the engine the linkages and arms leading
03:26
from the actuator to each of the fuel oil injection pumps must always work
03:31
smoothly this should be checked every day and Greece added in all joints and
03:38
couplings were needed
