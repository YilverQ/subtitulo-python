10:08
check the starting air pressure
10:17
you
10:30
check start interlocks
10:38
you
10:51
start the engine click the key switch to prepare for start then press the start
10:58
button
11:10
check all manometers click on various buttons for details
11:23
you
11:29
check the start air piping if a pipe becomes hot this indicates a defective
11:36
starting valve which must be replaced immediately
11:42
there are two ways of stopping the engine auto stop
11:50
click on the buttons to Nome Auto stop the control system stops the engine by
11:58
making the actuator set the fuel rack position to zero and by activating the
12:02
pneumatic stop cylinders no valves should be manually operated and
12:07
electrical switches remain in auto mode
12:19
Manuel stop the engine can be stopped from the PLC cabinet or from the engine
12:25
panel with a switch marked stop this will make the actuator set the fuel rack
12:32
to zero position which will result in an immediate stop when the engine is idle
12:37
this is regarded as a normal stop when the engine is running on load it will be
12:43
regarded as an emergency stop because the abrupt halt may cause damage to the
12:48
engine and generator in case of any labor on or close to the engine the
12:54
following should be done after the engine has stopped
12:57
switch off the key switch on the engine panel close the starting air valve put
13:04
up signs do not start engine maintenance in progress in every place the engine
13:10
can be started from the engine has to be cooled wait one hour before starting the
13:17
labor stop the system pumps drain and closed valves in the involved systems
13:31
you
13:40
you are performing a daily check of the engine then you discover that the
13:45
exhaust temperature of one of the cylinders is too high compared to the
13:49
others even though it is not triggering the alarm
13:53
it is important to find out why the exhaust temperature is too high what
13:59
would you do
14:03
specify the procedure by dragging the actions so they are listed in a suitable
14:08
water
14:16
you
14:20
suggested procedure for too high exhaust temperature
14:30
check the exhaust temperatures in the monitoring system and compare this to
14:35
the temperature reported on the engine panel
14:42
click on the buttons if these temperatures deviate one of the
14:47
thermocouples is probably defective
14:53
however in check the position of the fuel rack on the fuel oil pump compare
15:00
the position of the fuel rack to the original position from the startup of
15:04
the engine as shown in the form from Al Steinberg in service personnel if the
15:11
position is changed return it to its original state how to change the
15:16
position of the fuel rack open the screw
15:24
change the position of the fuel rack close the screw
15:36
you
15:49
for HFO operation check that the fuel rec and control sleeve are not stuck if
15:57
the fuel rack or control sleeve are sticky and do not move easily because of
16:01
dirt or solidified heavy fuel the fuel injection pump cleaning system has to be
16:07
checked and started
16:16
check the linkage from the actuator to the fuel rack check that the screws and
16:22
nuts in the linkage of not loosened check for we're from the linkage check
16:29
that all flexible arms and for linkages are moving easily
16:40
measure max pressure on all cylinders the engine must be running at 100% load
16:48
when measuring the maximum pressure fasten the pressure gauge on the
16:53
indicator valve at the side of the cylinder head open the indicator valve
16:58
by using the hand wheel
17:04
note the maximum pressure close the indicative valve by using the hand wheel
17:12
remove the pressure gage and repeat the sequence for all cylinders calculate the
17:18
average maximum pressure if the cylinder in question has a maximum pressure which
17:23
is less than three bar from average it is probably an incidental variation and
17:28
no further action is necessary at this time however you should still monitor
17:33
the exhaust temperatures regularly
17:40
check the rotor caps on the exhaust valves the purpose of the roto caps is
17:46
to prolong the lifetime of the exhaust valves by rotating them mark the
17:51
retainer cap on the rotor cops on the cylinder head for instance with a white
17:55
pen if the valve is not rotating the rotor cap is broken it has to be
18:01
replaced
18:08
stop the engine the engine must be stopped before you proceed
18:19
check the air inlet and exhaust valves check the clearances on the air inlet
18:26
and exhaust valves this can be done on warm or cold engines use a tire gauge to
18:32
measure the inlet and exhaust valve clearances place the feeler gauge
18:38
accurately use a screwdriver to bend the brackets and all transfer are compare
18:46
the clearances to the maximum clearances given in all Steinberg ins service
18:50
manual
18:58
you
19:04
check the nozzle and/or nozzle pin the easiest way to test the nozzle on the
19:10
problem cylinder is to switch the fuel oil injection valve with another start
19:17
the engine when the engine is running on a hundred percent loads and the exhaust
19:23
temperatures have stabilized observe if the problem follows the injection valve
19:28
if the problem follows the injector stopped the engine and replaced the
19:33
valve and perform a functional test as described in all steam Bergin's service
19:37
manual
19:42
you are performing a daily check of the engine their new discover that the
19:46
exhaust temperature of one of the cylinders is too low compared to the
19:50
others even though it is not triggering the alarm
19:55
it is important to find out why the exhaust temperature is too low what
20:00
would you do
20:03
specify the procedure by dragging the actions so they are listed in a suitable
20:08
order
20:16
you
20:22
check the exhaust temperatures in the monitoring system and compare these to
20:26
the temperature reported on the engine panel
20:34
if these temperatures deviate click on the buttons to learn more
20:43
however in some cases this procedure will not reveal the error in those cases
20:48
that most probable errors are injection is too far advanced the pre injection
20:54
think'll has to be adjusted faulty fuel oil injection pump the pump must be
21:00
overhauled or changed
21:06
check the position of the fuel rack on the fuel oil pump compare the position
21:11
of the fuel rack to the original position from the startup of the engine
21:15
as shown in the form from all stain bergen service personnel if the position
21:21
is changed return it to its original state
21:25
how to change the position of the fuel rack open the screw
21:35
change the position of the fuel rec close the screw
21:46
you
21:57
for HFO operation check that the fuel rack and control sleeve are not stack if
22:04
the fuel rail core control sleeve are sticky and do not move easily because of
22:08
dirt or solidified heavy fuel the fuel injection pump cleaning system has to be
22:13
checked and started
22:21
check that the screws and nuts in the linkage of not loosened check for wear
22:26
on the linkage check that all flexible arms and linkages are moving easily
22:40
the engine must be running at a hundred percent load when measuring the maximum
22:44

average maximum pressure if the cylinder in question has a maximum pressure which
23:18
is less than three bone from average it is probably an incidental variation and
23:23
no further action is necessary at this time however you should still monitor
23:28
the exhaust temperatures regularly
23:38
you
23:44
check for fuel oil leakage in the high-pressure pipe
23:53
check for possible cooling water leakage check the water level in the expansion
23:59
tank
24:03
check the exhaust gas if it is light and smoky it indicates that there is water
24:09
in the cylinder if water leakage is suspected the cylinder head and the
24:14
cylinder have to be checked check all gaskets and replace them if
24:19
necessary
24:24
stop the engine the engine must be stopped before you proceed
24:36
the easiest way to test the nozzle on the problem cylinder is to switch the
24:42
fuel oil injection valve with another on the engine start the engine when the
24:47
engine is running on a hundred percent load and the exhaust temperatures have
24:52
stabilized observe if the problem follows the injection valve if the
24:56
