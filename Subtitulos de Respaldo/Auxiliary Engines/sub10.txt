Fire there will always be a certain danger of fire when running a diesel
00:28
engine a combination of leaking fuel oil and hopped engine parts may start a fire
00:35
that can be very damaging to the engine and in some cases dangerous for the
00:41
engine crew leakages in the high-pressure part of the fuel system
00:46
may create situations where the probability of a fire increases it is of
00:52
utmost importance to undertake inspections of these parts and carry out
00:57
preventative measures against this on a regular basis Thermal hazards fuel oil
01:06
pipes may be very hot and should not be touched even though they're insulated be
01:13
aware that fuel oil pipes leading from the heavy fuel oil feeder booster module
01:18
to the engine may be steam traced when performing maintenance on the fuel oil
01:25
system remember that heavy fuel oil is very hot fewer lawyers are flammable and
01:32
should be treated with care they may also irritate skin so rinse off fuel oil
01:38
as soon as possible take note not to wear clothing that is
01:43
soaked with oil all bill Stine beragon main and auxiliary engines can be
01:52
operated on heavy fuel oil and a certain conditions which include heavy fuel oil
01:57
and lubricating oil quality and the equipment which is needed
03:06
a safely an indicator valve is fitted outside the cylinder head by means of
03:12
this valve the maximum pressure in each cylinder should be measured once a month
03:17
the measuring must be carried out with a hundred percent load on the engine log
03:24
the maximum combustion pressures and exhaust temperatures find causes and
03:30
rectify if combustion pressure in one cylinder differs more than three bar
03:37
from the average maximum at full load
03:41
abnormal change in the exhaust temperature of one cylinder is indicated

04:03
the fever booster module feeds heavy fuel oil to the engines the module
04:10
consists of equipment ensuring that the fuel oil is correctly filtered and that
04:15
it will have the correct temperature and viscosity when entering the engine the
04:21
feeder booster module consists of the following main components to suction
04:27
strainers to feeder pumps of which one is a standby pump mixing pipe deaeration
04:36
vessel to boost the pumps of which one is a standby pump to fuel heaters
04:47
automatic filter with separate manual bypass filter viscosity control system
04:57
duplex fine filter
05:09
the oil temperature and oil pressure on the fuel oil outlet should be recorded
05:14
every day
05:24
the change of a valve is equipped with a switch for heavy fuel or diesel oil
05:29
operation a light indicates that the engine is running on marine diesel oil
05:35
or heavy fuel oil oil in a disconnected fuel oil system can circulate through
05:43
the valve and is thereby kept heated to correct temperature
05:58
the cock enables switching between the filter elements enabling replacement
06:03
while the engine is in operation
06:24
in addition to logging the fuel oil pressure after the filter the filter
06:28
elements have to be checked at least once a month how often they have to be
06:34
replaced depends on the fuel oil quality
06:42
make sure that the filter that is going to be dismantled is not in operation by
06:47
checking the cock position open the vent plug empty the filter housing of diesel
06:57
oil by unscrewing the plug this is not necessary for checking the element
07:06
unscrew the nuts and remove the cover
07:12
remove the filter element from the housing and check the element
07:22
wash out all oil sediments in the filter housing blow the housing clean with
07:29
compressed air
07:39
place the text in the correct sequence
07:47
wrong you have no more tries we will show you the answer
07:59
put the new filter element into the filter housing fit the cover with the
08:05
Nets then the filter by turning the vent plug one revolution until pure oil flows
08:12
out of the drain pipe connected to the nipple further venting is done by
08:16
loosening the plug until the oil is free of air bubbles assure that pipe
08:22
couplings and plugs are tightened and that there are no leakages from the
08:26
filter housing
08:43
the fuel oil injection pumps inject the correct amount of fuel into the
08:47
combustion chamber via short high-pressure pipes and the injection
08:53
valves the pumps are driven by the camshaft via the push rods and regulated
09:00
by the regulator via the link arms all engines running on heavy fuel oil are
09:08
equipped with a cleaning system for the fuel injection pumps it is of great
09:17
importance to check the control levers and fuel pump
09:21
racks weekly for sticking tightening talks for nets and high-pressure fuel
09:28
pipes must be inside the tolerance given to high tightening may lead reduced flow
09:36
of fuel to the cylinders due to narrowing of the pipes
09:51
all engines running on heavy fuel oil are equipped with a cleaning system for
09:57
the fuel injection pumps in order to prevent the control rod and sleeve from
10:02
getting dirty and sticky
10:18
the fuel injection pump cleaning system should always be operating when running
10:24
on heavy fuel oil after cleaning or overhaul of the fuel injection pumps
10:31
start the cleaning system before the pumps checks the level in the diesel oil
10:38
tank
11:06
the fuel oil injection valve should provide the injection of fuel oil to the
11:11
combustion chambers when operating on heavy fuel oil the nozzles have to be
11:17
cooled this is done by the nozzle temperature control system a nozzle
11:26
should not be disassembled for inspection or changed unless the single
11:32
cylinder exhausts temperature deviates considerably from the average please
11:39
click the graphic showing the correct behavior of the fuel injection nozzle
11:43
during injection
11:53
high exhaust temperature one cylinder may be caused by leaking valves
12:00
incorrect injection timing or a leaking nozzle the problem is easily identified
12:08
by switching to valves and observing if the problem follows the nozzle the
12:16
cooling medium in the nozzle temperature control system is oil
12:35
and nozzle should not
12:44
we circulated also when the engine is running on diesel oil the coolant
12:50
temperature must be kept within the prescribed limits to low temperature may
12:56
cause corrosion on the nozzles
13:15
clean the filter once a week by turning the handle on the filter housing the
13:21
heat exchanger uses high temperature Jacket water for cooling it is fitted
13:28
with corrosion plugs which must be checked and be replaced in case of
13:33
leakage the nozzle coolant has to be circulated also when the engine is
13:42
running on diesel oil the coolant temperature must be kept within the
13:46
prescribed limits to low temperature may cause corrosion on the nozzles click the
