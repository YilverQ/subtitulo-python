The engine has two cooling water systems one high-temperature jacket water system
00:27
and one low temperature system only the high temperature system would be
00:33
described here the high temperature system is a freshwater cooling system
00:40
during operation or just after the engine has been stopped most of the
00:45
engine will be hot touching the engine parts may cause burns in this system be
00:52
especially aware of the following parts cooling water pipes may get up to 90
00:58
degrees Celsius the operator should always be aware of the high water
01:03
temperature when working with parts of the cooling water system pay attention
01:08
to how the additives are stored the additives to the cooling water may
01:13
involve a health risk especially when highly concentrated the operators are
01:20
responsible for keeping updated with the producers warnings on the containers or
01:25
data sheets parts of the engine to be cooled by the jacket water system is a
01:32
cylinder block the cylinder liners the cylinder heads and the turbocharger
01:42
control of cooling water quality is very important to prevent corrosion sediments
01:49
and surface growth in the jacket water cooling system it is important to use
01:55
inhibitors in the jacket water both for fresh water and for distilled water when
02:03
using inhibitors the service instructions have to be followed very
02:07
carefully with respect to the water quality supplement volume treatment and
02:14
storage changing high temperature cooling water empty and flush the
02:22
cooling system thoroughly before commencing treatment to remove as much
02:26
sludge and rest as possible if the system is exceptionally rusty
02:32
it is advisable to repeat this procedure after the first week or two of treatment
02:37
click the components for further information the jacket water pump is an
02:43
engine-driven centrifugal pump type it delivers water for cooling the
02:49
turbocharger and the high-temperature section of charge air cooler for engines
02:54
equipped with two stage charge air cooler the roller bearings are
03:00
lubricated by the main lube oil system
03:05
do not operate without proper water supply this will destroy the pump if
03:14
observing lubricating oil or water coming through the telltale hole replace
03:19
both sealing rings to ensure satisfactory sealing the heater module
03:26
consists of an electric pump with electric element the purpose of the
03:31
heater module is to keep the engine temperature at approximately 50 degrees
03:36
Celsius while the engine is in standby mode never operate without proper water
03:43
supply because that will destroy the ceramic seals in the pump immediately
03:49
the purpose of the regulating valve is to adjust the jacket water flow rate the
03:57
jacket water cooler removes heat from the jacket water and transfers it to the
04:02
raw seawater system the plate heat exchanger consists of edge clamped
04:08
frames within which a number of plates and gaskets are compressed
04:18
it is of great importance to inspect the high temperature water cooler during the
04:23
running in period in order to gain experience to determine the correct
04:29
intervals for cleaning when the call is out of operation for a longer period
04:35
empty it open it and clean it cleaning of the plates is important to restrict
04:44
corrosion and to keep the heat transfer rate at a maximum level plate exchangers
04:51
should be inspected and cleaned at regular intervals
