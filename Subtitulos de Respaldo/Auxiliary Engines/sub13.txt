Main lubricating oil system thermal hazard during operation or just after
00:28
the engine has been stopped most of the engine will be hot touching the engine
00:34
parts may cause burns in this system be especially aware of the following parts
00:41
lubricating oil pipes may get up to 70 degrees Celsius lubricating oil hazards
00:49
there will always be a certain health risk
00:53
concerning handling of lubricating oil inhaling fumes over prolonged time or
01:00
swallowing will lead to intoxication lubricating oil in eyes or on sensitive
01:08
skin will be irritating for specific hazards and countermeasures applying to
01:14
lubricating oil always read the producers information on the containers
01:20
and data sheets
01:54
the oil level in a running engine should always be between the maximum and
01:58
minimum levels on the dipstick try to keep the oil level as close to maximum
02:03
as possible the level in the oil sump should be measured manually every day in
02:10
addition to the electronic measurements of temperatures and pressures in the
02:13
lubricating oil system all thermometers and manometers should be checked and
02:20
recorded manually once a day it is recommended that samples of the
02:25
lubricating oil are regularly sent to the oil manufacturer for analysis from
02:32
the information gained from these samples it will be possible to determine
02:36
suitable intervals between oil changes the intervals between oil analysis
02:43
therefore should be decided after consulting the oil manufacturer when
02:48
taking oil samples it should be taken into consideration that the lubricating
02:53
oil from the engine is hot
02:58
click the components for further information the lube oil filter is of a
03:04
duplex type normally both filters are operating click the photo or the red
03:13
text to locate the components listed below
03:27
during maintenance or in case of malfunction one filter may be shut off
03:32
by using the cock this position will bypass the left filter this position
03:39
will bypass the right filter both filters are operating
03:46
if high viscosity the pressure drop across the filter increases the vowels
03:54
inside the filter will open and some oil will flow directly through the strainer
03:59
if this is not sufficient the valve will open and send part of the oil unfiltered
04:07
through the filter unit place the correct filter elements aside the unit
04:12
before starting to dismantle clean and dry all parts thoroughly mount new
04:21
filter elements place the text in the correct sequence wrong you have no more
04:30
tries we will show you the answer fill up the new filter slowly before
04:35
switching between them the filter should be inspected at least once every six
04:41
months even if the alarm is not triggered
