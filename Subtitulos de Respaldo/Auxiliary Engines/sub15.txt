from the bottles to the main starting air valve before the engine is started
00:49
to provide sufficient information about the operational parameters and to assure
00:54
that the operating staff will notice significant changes in the system it is
01:00
important that the values from the instruments have checked and recorded
01:05
every day click the component for further
01:09
information starting air compressors should have a sufficient capacity to
01:15
keep the pressure in the starting air bottles sufficiently high to start the
01:21
engine fill the bottles from atmospheric pressure to maximum pression 60 minutes

start air distributor a start air distributor supplies starting air to the
01:35
cylinders in correct order it is driven by the camshaft the relief valve
01:43
protects against overpressure in a system if the metal membrane in the
01:47
relief valve is broken the failure in the starting air system has to be
01:52
detected before start it is very important to place the disc correctly
