Operation and surveillance learning objectives the main objectives of this
00:06
section are to make the operators able to describe components and systems which
00:12
should be operating during startup describe components and systems which
00:19
should be in standby mode during startup recognize the components to operate
00:25
during startup describe what actually happens within the system during startup
00:32
describe the critical parameters and know where to find the measuring
00:36
instruments rectifying actions in case of deviation
01:02
before starting the engine after a period of standstill shorter than 24
01:07
hours the following routine should be performed to ensure a safe startup of
01:12
the engine if the fuel system has been disconnected it will be necessary to
01:18
expel trapped air in the system disconnect the high-pressure pipe
01:23
between some of the fuel injection pumps and fuel injection valves wait until all
01:30
the oil comes out of the pipe before reconnecting check the cooling water
01:35
system check jacket cooling water start on marine diesel oil check that the
01:43
jacket cooling water temperature is above 50 degrees Celsius for a warm
01:48
standby starting this makes the engine ready for instant loading to a hundred
01:53
percent between zero degrees and 50 degrees Celsius the engine can be cold
02:01
started on marine diesel oil the engine has to be loaded gradually and in a
02:08
minimum jacket water temperature of 50 degrees Celsius is reached if the jacket
02:14
water temperature is below zero degree Celsius the only starting attempts
02:19
should be emergency starts requirement for start on heavy fuel oil check that
02:27
the jacket water cooling water temperature is at least 50 degrees
02:31
Celsius if it's not run the heater until it reaches that temperature for start
02:39
and heavy fuel oil check fuel oil and nozzle oil temperatures in addition to
02:46
the jacket cooling water temperature the following temperature demands have to be
02:51
met to start on heavy fuel oil the temperature of the heavy fuel oil has to
02:56
be as required for the fuel oil injection viscosity the nozzle oil
03:01
temperature has to be 85 plus -5 degrees Celsius check control air pressure
03:09
ensure that the control air pressure is between 5 and 7 bar
03:14
check the lubricating oil systems check for cooling water leakage clean rocker
03:22
arm lubricating oil filter check the starting air pressure check start
03:29
interlocks when starting the engine after a period of standstill longer than
03:35
24 hours the following routine should be performed to ensure a safe startup of
03:41
the engine if the fuel system has been disconnected it would be necessary to
03:46
expel trapped air in the system disconnect the high-pressure pipe
03:53
between some of the fuel injection pumps and fuel injection valves wait until all
04:00
the oil comes out of the pipe before reconnecting check the cooling water
04:05
system open the lower temperature and the high temperature cooling water
04:11
valves check the high temperature cooling water level in the expansion
04:18
tank if the engine has been drained the high temperature system must be vented
04:25
start a marine diesel oil check that the jacket cooling water temperature is
04:32
above 50 degrees Celsius for a warm standby starting this makes the engine
04:39
ready for instant loading to a hundred percent between zero degrees and 50
04:45
degrees Celsius the engine can be cold started on marine diesel oil the engine
04:53
has to be loaded gradually and in a minimum jacket water temperature of 50
04:57
degrees Celsius is reached if the jacket water temperature is below zero degrees
05:03
Celsius the only starting attempts should be emergency starts requirement
05:11
for start on heavy fuel oil check that the jacket cooling water temperature is
05:16
at least 50 degrees Celsius if it's not run the heater until it reaches that
05:23
temperature for start and heavy fuel oil check fuel
05:28
oil and nozzle oil temperatures in addition to the jacket cooling water
05:32
temperature the following temperature demands have to be met to start on heavy
05:38
fuel oil the temperature of the heavy fuel oil has to be as required for the
05:43
fuel oil injection viscosity the nozzle oil temperature has to be 85 plus -5
05:50
degrees Celsius check the control air system check the control air module
05:57
ensure that the control air pressure is between 5 and 7 bar open the control air
06:05
quickly to avoid that the solenoid valves are placed in the center position
06:10
drain the control air module check the lubricating oil systems check for
06:17
cooling water leakage clean rocker arm lubricating oil filter check control
06:23
shaft check the starting air pressure check start interlocks start the engine
06:34
check all manometers check the start air piping before manual control stop run
06:44
engine for 5 minutes on no load to avoid boiling of cooling water you are
06:50
performing a daily check of the engine then you discover that exhaust
06:55
temperature one of the cylinders is too high compared to the others even though
07:01
it is not triggered an alarm it is important to find out why the exhaust
07:06
temperatures too high what would you do specify the procedure by dragging the
07:13
actions so they are listed in a suitable order on the sheet at EDD specify the
07:21
procedure by dragging the actions so they are listed in a suitable order on
07:26
the sheet at any time you can get more detailed information on any of the
07:32
actions by double clicking on it you are performing a daily check of the
07:38
engine then you discover that the exhaust temperature for one of the
07:42
cylinders is too low compared to the others even though it is not triggered
