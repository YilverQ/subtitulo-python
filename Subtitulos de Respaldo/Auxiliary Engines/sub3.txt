04:27
magnetic pickup on the flywheel cover which indicates the engine speed when
04:32
the speed exceeds 300 revs per minute the target relay sends the signal to the
04:37
speed controller indicating that the engine is running and starting air is
04:41
shut off the speed controller receives the speed signal from the magnetic
04:46
pickup on the flywheel cover while the engine speed is below normal running
04:50
speed it sends signals to the actuator fitted on the flywheel end of the engine
04:55
to increase engine speed the actuator transforms the electric signals to
04:59
mechanical movement and through arms and linkages it changes the admission of the
05:04
fuel oil injection pump in multi engine systems when the engine achieves normal
05:10
running speed the synchronizers start comparing frequency phases and voltage
05:14

important look for any leakages tighten and change seals if necessary
43:09
it is important that the value of these instruments are checked and recorded
43:13
every day according to the log sheet to ensure that the operating staff will
43:17
notice significant changes
43:27
you
43:29
the insulation and screen must always be in place when the engine is running
43:33
because the exhaust manifold is hot and contact may cause fire or burning
43:38
accidents
43:44
the exhaust gas from the engine drives the turbine which drives the compressor
43:48
the compressor unit sucks in and compresses the air required for the
43:52
engine
44:01
you
44:10
the compressor side of the turbocharger should be washed daily this should be
44:16
carried out at no less than 75 percent engine load remove the screw on the top
44:22
of the tank fill 0.4 liters of water into the water tank tighten the screw
44:30
actuate the valve towards the spring and hold it for about
44:34
10 seconds until all water has been injected
44:46
you
44:50
engines running on heavy fuel oil should have turbochargers turbine washed once a
44:56
week
45:04
you
45:25
run the engine on marine diesel oil during water washing open the drain cock
45:30
and ensure that hot exhaust is coming out of the drain pipe if not clear the
45:35
blockage I just charged air pressure to 0.3 bar
45:41
by reducing engine load run for five minutes before washing
45:54
you
46:02
connect cold water supply from ships fresh water system to water pressure
46:07
regulator connection
46:17
open water injection valves before carefully opening the water to the hose
46:22
check water pressure if necessary adjust 1 plus minus 0.2 bar
46:37
you
46:40
cleaning should go on for 10 minutes so that's only water vapors and some drops
46:45
of water will come out of the drain cock shut off water to the hose and close the
46:51
water injection valves disconnect the hose run the engine at same load for 5
46:57
minutes to dry up the turbine then shut the drain cock increase engine load to
47:03
normal for evaporating of condensed water
47:14
you
47:18
check the oil level once a day
47:24
the oil level should be inside the red circle while at standstill if the color
47:31
of the lube oil is turned significantly darker than it was the day before there
47:36
is a possibility of seriously damaging the turbocharger increased foaming and
47:42
the oil gauge glass is an indication that the oil should be changed remember
47:47
both bearings have their own oil reservoir
48:00
the turbocharger must not run when the oil is being changed open the drain plug
48:06
and the filling plug on the bearing housing cover and drain the used oil
48:15
thousand the drain plug fill the lubricating oil up to the upper mark on
48:21
the side glass
48:25
place a gasket on the filling plug and fasten it thoroughly remember both
48:31
bearings have their own oil reservoir generally we recommend synthetic
48:36
lubricating oil which should be changed at least once per 5000 hours
48:49
you
48:51
when refilling oil follows the same procedure as when changing oil except
48:56
from opening the drain plug
49:06
remember those bearings have their own oil reservoir
49:17
you
49:28
the main purpose of the charge air cooler is to reduce the temperature for
49:32
charge air pensions running on heavy fuel oil are always fitted with
49:37
two-stage coolers Stage one is connected into the engines jacket water circuit
49:42
while Stage two was cooled by seawater or low temperature fresh water the heat
49:48
from the jacket water is used to heat the charged air at low engine load
49:57
two-stage air coolers are fitted with drain channels to ensure detection of
50:02
leakages if there is a water leakage water will come out of the tail hole air
50:07
leakage can be detected by a whistling sound in case of water or air leakage
50:12
the end cover gasket has to be replaced if you see the water cooling system is
50:18
used the end cover should be disassembled at regular intervals for
50:22
inspection and cleaning when out of service for longer periods drain and
50:26
leave drain and venting cocks open if using sea water cooling flush with fresh
50:33
water
