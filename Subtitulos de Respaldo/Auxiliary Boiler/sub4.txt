After completion of this section you'll have an increased awareness of the safe
00:04
operation of an auxilary steam plant
00:27
we assume that the boiler has been out of operation for a while and that no
00:33
major maintenance work has been done check that the following valves are
00:37
closed main stop valve foam blowing valve bottom blowing valve vent valve on
00:45
economizer drain valve on economizer
00:59
check that the following valves are open all pressure gauge valves all level
01:06
gauge valves vent valve on steam drum vent valve on super heater drain valve
01:13
on super heater feed water valve
01:32
check that the tubing and connections the pressure gauges are open by blowing
01:37
through the tube must be full of condensate all the time
01:43
check the water level and refill if necessary use both auxilary and main
01:51
feedwater line for testing
02:00
start the air preheater check the combustion chamber for any oil spill if
02:05
everything is okay start the combustion air blower purge for two to four minutes
02:11
at full capacity re circle the fuel oil until you have the correct viscosity of
02:26
the burners select the smallest burner tips reduce the capacity on the blower
02:32
insert the torch and check the flame of the position of the torch open for fuel
02:38
to the burner and check for proper flame if okay remove the torch and check the
02:44
flame again if not okay closed fuel oil valve immediately and
02:50
increase the blower capacity to maximum again purge for two to four minutes
02:55
before you retry to ignite the burner depending on the size and design of the
03:01
boiler you should use one to two hours to reach full steam pressure this is to
03:08
avoid damage to the boiler furnace and tubes
03:31
after a while you can open the main steam valve
03:35
slightly to avoid sticking close the drain valve on the super heater keep the
03:41
vent valve on the super heater open until steam flow to consumers has been
03:47
established this steam flow is necessary to call the super heater blow through
04:06
the level gauges as the pressure is increasing the water level will rise but
04:12
be sure you're able to read the level all the time if the water level is too
04:17
high you can blow some of it off through the foam glowing valve do not use the
04:23
bottom blowing valve as long as you are firing the water level may also be too
04:28
low caused by draining and venting if you observe water hammering in the
04:33
economizer it should be cooled down by supply of feed water it is good practice
04:38
toward - between the burners during firing because this will make the
04:44
heating of the boiler more even when you have reached the operational pressure
04:48
you should start to heat the piping system by opening the drain valves check
04:54
for the water level is not too high before you open the main steam valve
04:59
this because the lower pressure on the steam line may cause water to enter the
05:04
super heater change the burner tips to normal size check again
05:10
oil air ratio before you switch to automatic control
05:31
check that the seawater valve with a condenser is closed and easy to open
05:36
open a seawater section valve and start seawater Panth slowly open the seawater
05:43
valve to the condenser and check the water flow start the condenser vacuum
05:48
pump steam ejector and check that it is working properly
05:54
when the pressures coming down check for the alarm condenser high-pressure is
05:59
reset start the condensate pump and check the condensate flow check that the
06:22
casing drain valve is open and check for water check that the steam supply valve
06:28
is closed open the steam exhaust valve completely check lubricating oil level
06:35
in the CEMP and possible water in the oil start the electrical lubricating oil
06:41
pump and check the pressure check differential pressure on the oil filter
06:46
open and check the gland steam system adjust the glam steam pressure when
06:54
there is a minor gland steam leaked to the atmosphere open to the glam steam
06:59
condenser close any heating of the new briquetting oil system reset the
07:05
emergency stop system open the stop valve slightly
07:39
check the turbine casing drain for water again continue to open the throttle
07:45
valve slowly until the turbine starts to rotate check for any unfamiliar sound
07:52
and vibrations keep the turbine rotating for a few minutes
07:58
increase the RPM until you reach idling speed or no load speed and continue to
08:06
run at this rpm for another five minutes check lubricating oil pressure and stop
08:13
the electrical lubricating oil pump check oil temperature and open for
08:19
lubricating oil cooling when above 40 degrees centigrade when the speed
08:24
control valve is in action open the emergency stop valve completely check
08:30
again that all indicates engaged readings are normal according to the
08:34
operating manual and transfer rpm control to remote control position
08:42
you
08:56
if possible you should start sub blowing before closing the oil fired boiler open
09:04
vent valve and drain valve slightly on the super heater close the oil to the
09:10
burners and remove them from the furnace keep the blower running for some time to
09:16
remove all gases from the furnace stop the blower and close the air intake to
09:22
avoid cold air entering the furnace when the steam pressures below normal
09:28
close the main steam valve when the steam pressures one to two bar you can
09:35
open the vent valve from the drain the super heater completely when the boiler
09:40
has cooled down the feed water valves must be closed shut down the air
09:46
preheater
