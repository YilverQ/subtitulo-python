The learning objectives of this section are to be acquainted with the main parts
00:04
of a steam plant understand the steam cycle
00:28
in this training module we will look to steam plant on a V LCC with diesel
00:35
engine as propulsion machinery the exhaust boiler capacity at MC R is
00:41
sufficient for the turbo generator and heating the oil fired boiler of the dual
00:46
pressure or double evaporation type as a capacity of 50 tons per hour at 15 bar
00:53
and 410 degrees centigrade the four main parts of a steam plant are boiler
01:02
turbine condenser feed water pump in the boiler we are heating water and steam by
01:11
burning oil some of the energy content of the steam is converted to mechanical
01:17
energy in the turbine
01:23
exhaust steam from the turbine is cooled in the condenser and the condensate
01:29
brought back to the boiler by the feed water pump the series of processes
01:34
involved is called a steam cycle the working principle of the dual pressure
01:47
boiler in the primary system water is heated by the oil burners in the
01:52
combustion chamber the steam from the primary system is fed to the heat
01:56
exchanger the secondary system as the primary system is completely closed this
02:02
system has several advantages the feedwater will never be contaminated and
02:08
will be free of any oxygen meaning that we will not have any scale formation or
02:14
corrosion on the water side we do not need deaerator in the primary system the
02:21
heating service will always be cooled by the water flow and this will eliminate
02:26
the danger of burning down tube stack as the primary steam is heating the
02:31
secondary steam the temperature will not rise above the evaporating temperature
02:36
30 bar corresponding to approximately 235 degree centigrade
02:43
this will reduce possible deposits on the heating coil in the secondary steam
02:48
drum in the oil fired boiler the water in the rises are heated and small
02:53
bubbles of steam are formed inside the tubes the steam water is active
03:05
operating temperature entering the steam drum and the colder water in a steam
03:09
drum is falling back to the water drum through the downcomers
03:13
this circulation will continue as long as we are firing the boiler
03:23
in the secondary steam drum the primary steam is entering the heating coils at a
03:29
temperature corresponding to the pressure the steam is condensed in the
03:37
coil and the water is flowing back to the steam drum of the primary system
03:43
the secondary steam leaves the drum at a pressure of say 15 bar and a temperature
03:49
of 100 97 degrees centigrade and is passing through the super heater before
03:54
it enters the turbine in the super heater the wet steam is heated to
03:59
approximately 410 degrees centigrade and it leaves the super heater completely
04:04
dry
04:26
the steam is entering the turbine casing throttled by a control valve depending
04:32
on the size and type of the turbine the steam is passing one or several groups
04:37
of nozzles the condenser is of a/c water-cooled tube and shell type a large
04:45
capacity condenser may have up to 6,000 tubes the vacuum in the condensers
04:51
normally obtained by using one or more steam driven ejectors by lowering the
04:56
vacuum when they pull more power out of the turbine but on the other hand the
05:01
temperature of the condensate will also be lower and the total plant efficiency
05:06
will be reduced feed water to the secondary system is pumped by a feed
05:12
water pump from the feed water tank through the economizer before it is
05:17
entering the secondary boiler drum
05:24
you
05:42
before we have a closer look the main components of the steam plant we will
05:47
repeat some of the fundamentals of steam production as you know the boiling
05:52
temperature of water is dependent on the pressure when we are heating the waters
05:58
at constant pressure the temperature will increase until we reach the
06:02
saturation temperature the water will start to evaporate and the necessary
06:08
amount of energy to achieve this is called enthalpy of evaporation this
06:15
energy will remain the steam into the steam is condensed when we continue to
06:20
heat the saturated water it will be drier become saturated steam the steam
06:26
and the steam water drum will always be saturated because it is in contact with
06:32
water
06:36
when all the water the steam has been evaporated and we still are adding more
06:41
heat the steam will be superheated at constant pressure the temperature would
06:47
increase and we are talking about degree of superheating after the steam has
06:57
passed the turbine to a third of the total energy content added in the boiler
07:02
has to be released to condensate the steam this energy is called the enthalpy
07:10
of condensation like evaporation temperature of water the condensation
07:15
temperature of steam is dependent on the pressure to minimize the loss of energy
07:20
in the condenser it is important to maintain the outlet temperature of the
07:25
condensate as high as possible this is achieved by controlling the condenser
07:29
pressure and the cooling water flow in addition to the major losses in the
07:34
condenser we have other minor losses like
07:39
the heat in the exhaust gas
07:44
incomplete combustion radiation losses from the boiler air steam and water
07:55
leakage this is reduced to a minimum by the heat transferred in the economizer
08:01
and the air preheater as the fuel oil contains sulfur care must be taken not
08:08
to reduce the gas temperature below the dew point of the sulfuric gas with a
08:13
sulfur content in the fuel of 0.5 percent the dew point is approximately a
08:19
hundred degrees centigrade and at five percent as high as 160 degrees
08:24
centigrade this is influenced by fuel oil viscosity burner maintenance fuel
08:32
oil pressure atomizing steam pressure a oil mixing a oil ratio and fuel oil
08:44
quality
08:47
radiation losses from the boiler casing and piping due to damaged insulation and
08:53
brickwork air leakage enforced draught fans and ducting including air preheater
09:03
any steam leakage in valves and piping system when we add up these losses we
09:10
end up with a thermal boil efficiency of approximately 90%
