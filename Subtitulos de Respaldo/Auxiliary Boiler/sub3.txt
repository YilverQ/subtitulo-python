The learning objectives of this section are to be acquainted with the following
00:04
boiler control systems combustion control burner management trip system
00:11
level control
00:33
the main objectives of the combustion control system are to supply fuel oil
00:38
according to the boiler load to control the combustion air supply according to
00:43
the fuel oil consumption to shut off the burners in case of an emergency a
00:48
cascade control system is used to obtain the best possible stability the system
00:55
is comprised of several controllers a master controller receives the steam
01:01
pressure and a steam flow signal the output signal from the master is the
01:06
input signal to the air controller and the fuel oil controller called the slave
01:12
controllers the control philosophy is that the slave controller has to take
01:18
care of the variations in the master controller output signal before this
01:22
effects the master controllers input signal the master input signal or the
01:29
process variable is the value that has to be constant in the first place to
01:35
maintain the best possible combustion during change of boiler load we need a
01:40
high-low selector which also receives a signal from the oxygen controller the
01:46
high-low selector makes it possible to increase the air flow before increase in
01:52
fuel oil flow when we increase spoil a load as we are reducing boiler load we
01:59
want to reduce the oil flow before we reduce the airflow by adding the signal
02:06
from the oxygen analyzer we can optimize the a oil ratio further this to
02:13
compensate for variations in fewer oil quality
02:17
airflow due to soot and reduced air blower capacity tuning of a cascade
02:23
control system is usually done the following way
02:27
set the slave controller in manual during normal operation tune the control
02:36
according to specifications in the operating manual when the master
02:43
controller input process variable is correct
02:47
adjust the slave controllers setpoint to the slave controller input signal when
02:56
this is completed the slave controller can be switched back to auto the master
03:04
controller must be in manual during firing of the boiler if it is necessary
03:09
to tune the master controller this must be done with the slave controller in
03:13
auto or remote setpoint mode carefully follow the instructions in the manual as
03:20
each burner has a limited capacity with an optimum range
03:25
we usually have several burners on each boiler to achieve the best possible
03:29
combustion and a various load conditions the burner management system will fire
03:34
and shut off the burners in sequence depending on the boiler load one burner
03:41
is selected as the master and the others are slaves a set steam pressure
03:46
deviation will activate the system the low and high pressure limits must
03:53
reflect the pressure control system settings
04:09
to avoid hazards to people and possible damage to the boiler a shutoff or
04:14
tripped system is always installed input to the trip system can be the following
04:20
signals flame failure combustion air failure air preheater failure high high
04:28
water level low low water level high high steam pressure the mergency stop
04:35
activated
04:46
all the signals are wired in a separate system and are not an integrated part of
04:51
the control system the trip system requires separate pressure and level
04:56
switches to maintain the correct water level during all normal operating
05:01
conditions we need an automatic level control system on boilers with a low
05:07
steam production and a high water content the level control system only
05:13
measures the water level and controls the feed water flow by a control valve
05:22
on boilers with a high esteem production and low water content the level control
05:29
system is usually based on signals from the steam consumption and the feed water
05:34
supply in addition to the water level a sudden increase in steam consumption
05:39
results in a pressure drop in the steam water drum and the water level increases
05:45
and vice versa this is why we need to compare steam consumption with the feed
05:51
water supply before we introduce major changes the feed water supply
