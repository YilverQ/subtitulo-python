After completion of the section you'll be able to identify all major components
00:05
and explain their design and function
00:28
the boiler is a complicated construction of steel tubes pipes and drums the
00:37
primary boiler of the d-type has an upper and a lower drum connected
00:42
together with hundreds of tubes and pipes the upper drum is the steam water
00:47
drum and the lower one the water drum water is circulating inside the pipes
00:54
that are arranged as warz
00:59
inside the furnace the water in the risers is heated by the flames from the
01:04
oil burners as the density of waters 30 times the density of steam the mixture
01:12
of steam and water will flow to the top drum the heavier water in the top drum
01:17
will flow back to the lower drum through the downcomers
01:21
outside the furnace Wars the steam water mixture travels around in the boiler to
01:28
velocity of zero point three to one meters per second in the epiderm the
01:36
steam will leave the water saturated steam the water content of approximately
01:41
0.25 percent primary steam is entering the evaporating coil in the secondary
01:47
steam drum and is condensed as the energy is transferred to the secondary
01:52
steam system this steam is heated above boiling temperature and is passing the
02:01
super heater in the furnace close to the burners the temperature can reach to a
02:05
thousand degrees centigrade so it is very important that we always have a
02:10
sufficient flow steam through the super heater when we are firing the boiler
02:24
you the feed water coming from the
02:27
economizer is always colder than the water in the boiler it is mixed to the
02:34
hot water by a long perforated feed pipe inside the upper drum
02:40
approximately 30% of the energy the fuel oil to the diesel engine is lost in the
02:46
exhaust gas to utilize some of this energy loss we install exhaust gas
02:52
boilers and yep take
02:56
exhaust gas dampers control the amount of heat allowed through to the
03:01
evaporating coils in the boiler as this boiler is an integrated part of the
03:06
total steam plant a set of circulation pumps forced the feed water through the
03:12
exhaust gas boiler when we are firing the boiler the exhaust gas boiler is
03:17
equipped with such blowers to keep it clean and efficient to minimize the loss
03:23
of energy in the exhaust gas several types of air preheater
03:28
have been developed young strums rotating air preheater is a common type
03:34
several thousands of steel plates are arranged in a large cylindrical housing
03:40
an electrical motor turns the preheater at a rate of two to five revolutions per
03:46
minute the exhaust gas heats about 60% the steel plates and at the same time
03:53
the air cools the remaining 40% the air preheater works according to the counter
04:00
flow principle bypassed dampers on the air and exhaust side controlled the flow
04:07
exhaust temperature below 110 degree centigrade results in the formation of
04:13
sulfuric acid the economizer is placed in exhaust gas uptake below the air
04:19
preheater this can be a single unit or several units working together the feed
04:26
water pump pushes the feed water through the economizer before it enters the
04:31
steam water drum the water temperature can increase to above 230 degrees
04:38
centigrade
04:53
if the economizer temperature gets too high the feed water will start to
04:59
evaporate and the steam may reduce the free flow of feed water to increase the
05:10
energy content of the steam and thereby the steam plant thermal efficiency and
05:15
dry it completely the saturated steam passes the super heater before it leaves
05:22
the boiler
05:29
like the economizer the superheater can be arranged differently from one type of
05:35
boiler to another usually the superheater tubes are protected by one
05:39
or more walls of risers in this way the hottest gases past these risers first
05:47
and a combustion temperature is less harmful to the superheated tubes the
05:52
steam outlet temperature from the super heater can be well above 500 degrees
05:57
centigrade not all machinery and equipment are operated by superheated
06:03
steam we still want to keep the high pressure and therefore we only want to
06:08
reduce the temperature this is done by adi super heater
06:18
a simple and common way of de-superheating is to inject water in a
06:25
steam flow
06:32
some boilers have a separate steam cooling coil inside the lower water drum
06:37
D superheated steam can be used for reciprocating machinery heating and
06:44
optimising steam the purpose of the D aerator is to be an expansion tank for
06:51
the condensate from the condenser as the flow of water to the boiler vary with a
06:56
load to remove air and other non condensable gases from the feed water
07:01
feed water pre heater as it is mixing steam and water it may be a condenser
07:08
for several - steam consumers the deaerator is placed approximately 10
07:13
metres above the feed water pump and will by that to protect the pump from
07:19
the steam flashing and cavitation by heating the feed water with steam the
07:25
air will boil off and be led to the atmosphere a level control system will
07:31
maintain a constant water level in the deaerator during normal operation of the
07:37
boiler there would always be soot and other deposits on the heat surface and
07:42
in the uptake of the boiler the suit is mostly carbon from incomplete combustion
07:48
of fuel oil that Ash and vanadium can also be a problem
07:54
search blowing has to take place regularly to maintain the thermal
07:58
efficiency of the boiler an increase in exhaust temperature after the air
08:03
preheater of 10 degrees centigrade is a good indication and when to start such
08:08
blowing the suit blower equipment on a large boiler is complicated and needs a
08:19
lot of maintenance the number and types of such blowers depend on the type and
08:25
the make of the boiler we have suit blower types like a long-stroke
08:31
retractable blower this can be electrical or a operated and
08:36
is usually placed in hot gas areas like the super heater section the multi dual
08:42
nozzle blower this is placed in lower temperature areas like air preheater and
08:48
economizer typical steam consumption per blower can be 2 kilos 4 seconds and air
08:54
consumption 130 cubic meters per minute the operation will take approximately
09:00
one minute but there will only be sucked blowing for 20 seconds
09:05
an electrical driven centrifugal type of blower supplies combustion air through a
09:11
short duct to the air preheater
09:16
from the air preheater the ducting follows the boiler front to the oil
09:21
burners even if the blowers have a controlled damper on the suction side
09:25
they may have a two to four step revolutions per minute controller this
09:31
is because it can have a major difference in boiler load during normal
09:35
operation on its way to the furnace the air passes control dampers or air
09:41
registers before it is mixed thoroughly with the fuel oil the fuel oil will only
09:47
be present in the furnace for a fraction of a second ask for a diesel engine tis
09:53
therefore very important that the fuel oil is properly atomized and mixed with
09:58
a combustion air if the fuel oil is not completely and immediately burning small
10:05
particles of oil will form soot and other deposits in the furnace and
10:10
exhaust uptake this will reduce the heat transfer and excessive search blowing is
10:17
necessary to maintain the boiler efficiency to obtain the best possible
10:22
atomizing several types of burners have been developed pressure atomizing using
10:30
high pressure oil pumps
10:33
steam or air atomizing using low pressure saturated steam when there is
10:40
no steam available for fuel oil heating and atomizing we use diesel oil to start
10:46
firing the boiler and later on changed fuel oil
10:52
rotating burners driven by an electrical motor possible reasons for combustion
10:58
problems can be poor atomizing check change burner tip to low atomizing steam
11:08
pressure too much water in the steam fuel oil too low oil pressure check pump
11:17
and filters wrong fuel oil viscosity too little combustion air to low speed on
11:24
air blower malfunction of air damper control deposits on air blower deposits
11:31
in the air preheater air or exhaust side tuning of air oil ratio controller
11:40
deposits on economizer all boilers shall be provided with at least two safety
11:47
valves on the steam drums so last chapter two one if it is possible to
11:54
close off super heater and economize a sections during firing and they are
11:59
still subject to combustion gases they must have separate safety valves the
12:05
size of the safety valve should at least be sufficient to prevent the steam
12:09
pressure from increasing more than 10% above normal pressure even if the oil
12:16
burners are working at full capacity for 15 minutes and all steam valves are
12:22
closed the safety valves must have an arrangement that makes it possible to
12:28
release the boiler pressure from deck and engine room
12:34
on boilers with working pressure after 20 bar the safety valve is normally of
12:39
the spring-loaded type the tension of the spring can be adjusted when the
12:45
steam pressure increases above the spring load the valve will open and the
12:50
steam will act on a ring in the valve housing the valve keeps open until the
12:56
steam pressure is reduced below normal operating pressure another type of
13:01
safety valve is the full stroke valve a small spring-loaded valve is first
13:07
activated by the increased steam pressure this valve is a pilot valve for
13:12
the full stroke valve and the steam pressure would push a piston that opens
13:17
the safety valve
13:27
to convert the heat and pressure energy in the steam entering the turbine the
13:32
steam passes one or several groups of nozzles these nozzles can be of the
13:40
convergent or the convergent divergent type in the convergent nozzle the
13:46
velocity of steam increases until the velocity of sound of that particular
13:51
pressure the pressure drop in the nozzle is called the critical pressure drop to
13:57
obtain the total pressure drop this type of turbine has several wheels with an
14:02
increasing diameter on the blades towards the outlet side of the turbine
14:10
the convergent divergent type of nozzle also called the Laval nozzle has an
14:18
expansion of the steam volume in the divergent part of velocity and can be as
14:23
high as 800 meters per second typical turbines of this type of feed
14:29
water turbines cargo pump turbines and turbine driven generators this type of
14:36
turbine is often called the Curtiss turbine the steam velocities brought
14:42
down in two steps from the Laval nozzle the steam enters the first rotating
14:47
wheel and leaves this in the opposite direction
14:52
passing through the fixed nozzles then entering the second rotating wheel and
14:57
the steam velocity is now close to zero when it leaves the last blade the
15:04
working principle of this turbine is called the impulse type because of the
15:09
high esteem velocity this type of turbine is not very efficient and
15:13
consequently not used as main propulsion machinery turbines can also be
15:19
categorized as back pressure or vacuum condenser types some of the energy in
15:25
the steam is converted to a cinematic energy in the nozzles and enters the
15:30
turbine rotor blades with a velocity of several hundred meters per second for
15:36
each turbine wheel the steam pressure drops until most of the available energy
15:41
in the steam is converted to mechanical work exhaust steam enters the condenser
15:48
at low pressure temperature and a volume up to 500 times higher than on the inlet
15:55
side of the turbine the condensate is pumped by a condensate pump to the
16:00
deaerator
16:12
we have several types of feed water pumps depending on the size and type of
16:17
the boiler installation on a large installation we normally have two
16:22
identical steam turbine driven centrifugal pumps each of the pumps have
16:27
a capacity well above the total boiler capacity in addition to the two main
16:33
pumps we also have an auxilary pump this can be a reciprocating type and used to
16:40
fill the boiler aft inspection and maintenance work
