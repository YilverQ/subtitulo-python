This lesson will give a short introduction on how to start an alfa
00:04
laval freshwater generator
00:28
you will now be guided through the starting procedure of an alfa laval
00:32
fresh water generator open the valves on the section and discharge side of the
00:39
ejector pump
00:42
open the Overboard valve for combined air Brian ejector close the air valve on
00:50
the upper part of the separator vessel
00:55
set the main switch to position 1 start the ejector pump check the pressure
01:03
before ejector minimum 0.28 to 0.3 mega Pascal's after ejector maximum 0.06 mega
01:15
Pascal's when there is a minimum of 90% vacuum
01:20
open the hot water inlet and outlet vowels from the jacket cooling system
01:27
start the hot water supply to the evaporator section by adjusting the
01:32
bypass valve until the desired jacket water temperature difference is reached
01:37
which is 80 degrees Celsius for the inlet and 72 degrees Celsius for the
01:43
outlet the boiling temperature inside the separator vessel ought to be about
01:48
45 degrees Celsius
01:54
start the fresh water pump when the salinity level drops below the set alarm
02:00
point set the secondary alarm on improper or too low hot water flow
02:07
adjust bypass will result in low boiling water temperature and a drop in the
02:13
freshwater production hi Brian level in the sight glass in the separator vessel
02:19
higher than the set alarm point thus dumping it to bilge is recommended the
02:25
solenoid valve on the discharge side of fresh water pump stays open
02:30
when evaporation starts the boiling temperature rises while the vacuum
02:35
achieved drops to approximately 93% after a few minutes normal vacuum and
02:43
boiling temperature is reestablished salinity drops below the set alarm point
02:48
and the solenoid valve closes
