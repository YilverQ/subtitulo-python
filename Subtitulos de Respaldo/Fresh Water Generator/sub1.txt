This lesson will give a short introduction on the working principles
00:03
of the Alfa Laval freshwater generator
00:28
the function of the freshwater generator is to convert seawater into freshwater
00:34
by vacuum distillation for the supply of high-quality fresh water for domestic
00:40
and process utilization it is made for installation on ships and rigs and
00:47
remote onshore locations the Alfa Laval freshwater generator
00:54
jwp 26c is designed for automatic operation with continuous control of
01:01
freshwater quality
01:07
the generators features are simple compact design titanium heat exchanger
01:15
plates and others see water resistant materials non-coated
01:20
combined condenser cooling ejector water and feed water system fresh water
01:27

01:31
some of the advantages of using alpha Laval's fresh water generator high
01:36
quality fresh water the low content of dissolved solids salinity ensures a
01:43
supply of pure water which can be used directly as makeup for steam boilers the
01:50
long lifespan high-grade corrosion resistant materials such as the titanium
01:56
plates ensure the long life of the equipment low operation and maintenance
02:01
costs start and forget operation combined with easy access to the
02:06
interior reduces the number of man hours required for operation and maintenance
02:11
to a minimum simple installation due to compact design low weight and the
02:18
ability to be assembled on the spot
02:23
the Alfa Laval fresh water generator jwp 26 C series covers a capacity range from
02:31
4 to 35 cubic meters per 24 hours depending upon the heating medium and
02:37
cooling water temperatures the values Illustrated are based on a cooling water
02:43
temperature of 32 degrees Celsius distillers can be dimensioned to suit
02:48
any jacket water temperature from 55 to 95 degrees Celsius and suit any cooling
02:55
water temperature required the quantity of fresh water produced can be altered
03:01
within each size by varying the number of plates in the heat exchanger
03:05
assemblies
03:11
the feedwater to be distilled is taken from the sea cooling water outlet of the
03:16
condenser it enters the evaporator where it evaporates at about 40 to 50 degrees
03:23
Celsius as it passes between the plates heated by the heating medium the
03:28
evaporating temperature corresponds to a vacuum of 90 to 95 percent maintained by
03:35
the brine air ejector the vapors generated passed through a D mr. where
03:41
any drops of seawater entrained are removed and fall due to gravity into the
03:47
brine sump in the bottom of the distiller chamber the clean fresh water
03:52
vapors continue to the condenser where they condense into fresh water as they
03:58
pass between the cold plates cooled by the sea cooling water in order to
04:04
continuously check the quality of the fresh water produced acelino meter is
04:09
provided together with an electrode unit fitted on the fresh water pump delivery
04:15
side if the salinity of the freshwater produced exceeds the permitted maximum
04:21
value the solenoid valve and alarm are then activated to automatically dump the
04:28
freshwater produced into the bilge

the JW 26c freshwater generator is designed for automatic operation in
05:26
periodically unmanned engine rooms and other automated operations the heating
05:33
medium is either engine jacket cooling water or a closed circuit heated by
05:39
steam the ejector pump is installed separately and has a separate suction
05:45
from the sea chest this pump supplies coolant in the form
05:50
of seawater to the condenser feed water for evaporation and water for the
05:56
combined brine air ejector the built in freshwater pump pumps the freshwater
06:02
produced into the tank the control panel which is installed separately with motor
06:08
starters and saline ohmmeter supplies electrical power to the ejector and
06:13
fresh water pumps and control voltage to the saline
