Understanding the need to take necessary safety
00:22
precautions during maintenance for the
00:25
electrical installations before
00:31
attempting any electrical work there are
00:33
some basic precautions you must bear in
00:36
mind the possible dangers arising from
00:40
the misuse of electrical equipment are
00:42
well known electric shock and fire
00:46
caused loss of life and damage to
00:49
equipment regulations exist to control
00:53
the construction installation operation
00:56
and maintenance of electrical equipment
00:58
in order to reduce the element of danger
01:02
as much as possible where danger arises
01:05
it is usually due to accident neglect
01:08
off another contravention of the
01:10
regulations electrical equipment and
01:13
services and board ships must meet the
01:16
minimum standards specified by the
01:18
various national and international
01:21
organizations the standards specified by
01:26
the various organizations are met when a
01:29
ship is designed built approved and
01:31
classified it is the ship owner and is
01:34
staffs responsibility to maintain the
01:37
vessel and its electrical equipment in
01:40
compliance with the requirements of the
01:42
classification society throughout the
01:45
ship's lifetime the periodic electrical
01:49
survey every four years is for checking
01:52
that the installations meet the
01:54
requirements the classification society
01:57
the ship's staff must operate equipment
02:00
in a safe manner and maintain it in a
02:03
safe condition at all times failure to
02:07
do so is dangerous and could have
02:10
disastrous consequences the ship staff
02:14
should keep in mind an essential list of
02:16
do's and don'ts when working on
02:19
electrical equipment do get to know the
02:24
ship's electrical system and equipment
02:26
study the ship's diagrams
02:29
to pinpoint the location of switches and
02:31
protection devices supplying
02:33
distribution boards and essential items
02:36
of equipment right down this information
02:40
in a notebook note the normal indication
02:44
from switchboards instruments so that
02:46
abnormal operation can we quickly
02:49
detected do operate the equipment
02:52
according to the manufacturer's
02:54
recommendations do maintain equipment
02:57
according to the manufacturer's
03:00
recommendations or the ship owners
03:03
maintenance procedures do check that
03:06
circuits are dead by using a voltage
03:09
tester before touching conductors and
03:12
terminals do switch off and lock off
03:15
supplies remove fuses and display
03:19
warning notices before removing
03:22
equipment covers prior to maintenance to
03:25
ensure that all guards covers and doors
03:29
are securely fitted and that all bolts
03:32
and fittings are fitted and tightly
03:35
secured don't neglect or abuse equipment
03:40
don't leave conductors or rotating parts
03:45
exposed don't touch rotating parts don't
03:49
touch live conductors under any
03:52
circumstances you should think safety at
03:57
all times and developed an attitude of
04:00
safety consciousness this may well save
04:04
your life from the lives of others most
04:07
accidents occur due to momentary loss of
04:10
concentration or attempt the
04:12
short-circuit standard safety procedures
04:15
do not let it happen to you nearly
04:22
everyone has experienced an electric
04:24
shock at some time at best it is an M
04:29
pleasant experience at worst it is
04:32
faithful anyone who has access to live
04:36
electrical equipment must be fully
04:38
familiar with first aid and safety
04:41
procedures related electric
04:43
och as described in relevant safety act
04:46
copies of these safety procedures should
04:50
be displayed on board ship electric
04:57
shock is caused by the flow of current
04:59
through your body this is often from
05:03
hand to hand off from hand to foot a
05:06
shock current as low as 15 milli amp AC
05:10
or DC may be fatal obviously the size of
05:16
the shock current is related to the
05:18
applied voltage and your body's
05:20
resistance and fortunately your body's
05:24
resistance goes down as applied voltage
05:27
goes up this means that the shock
05:31
current is further increased at high
05:34
voltages the amount of your body
05:38
resistance also depends on other factors
05:41
such as your state of health the degree
05:44
of contact with live wires and the
05:46
amount of perspiration or dampness on
05:49
your skin typical dry full contact body
05:52
resistance is about 5,000 ohms at 25
05:57
votes fall into 2000 ohms at 250 volts
06:02
elect shock is often accompanied by
06:06
falling which may cause additional
06:08
physical injury and require first-aid
06:11
action if the shock victim is
06:14
unconscious resuscitation must take
06:17
place first before doing anything else
06:19
check the resuscitation techniques
06:22
illustrators on the electric shock
06:25
posters displayed on board all equipment
06:32
is subject to wear and tear eventually
06:35
reaching the end of its useful life when
06:37
it must be replaced as equipment nears
06:41
the end of its life its condition
06:43
determines to what an extent it poses a
06:46
danger to personnel and other power
06:49
plants the purpose of maintenance
06:51
therefore is to extend the useful life
06:54
of equipment by
06:57
air and or replacement of defective
07:00
parts and to maintain it in a safe and
07:03
serviceable condition the marine
07:09
environment is particularly arduous full
07:12
elective equipment to the damp fault
07:15
Laden atmosphere extremes of temperature
07:18
and constant vibration shitball
07:22
equipment is in particular need of
07:24
correct maintenance the continuous
07:28
operation of equipment on board a ship
07:30
demands high operating efficiency and
07:33
optimum economy in order to keep down
07:36
costs to maintain financial
07:38
competitiveness nearly all equipment
07:44
needs maintenance an efficiency engineer
07:47
or electrician must get to know his
07:50
plant he must be able to check the
07:53
ship's drawings and diagrams and relate
07:56
them to actual equipment equipment must
07:59
be kept under continuous observation so
08:02
that normal healthy operating conditions
08:04
become familiar and abnormal operation
08:07
can be quickly observed faults should be
08:12
pinpointed and corrected before
08:15
breakdown occurs caution if it is
08:19
necessary to work on live equipment and
08:22
the operator must be fully protected
08:25
only rubber gloves that are specially
08:28
made for this purpose should be used
08:30
caution always ensure that the generator
08:35
prime mover is shut down and locked off
08:38
before you begin your maintenance also
08:42
check that the generator circuit breaker
08:44
is locked off auto start circuits are
08:48
disabled and generate electric heaters
08:50
are isolated caution generator circuit
08:54
breakers must be switched off and
08:57
isolated from the best spas for
08:59
maintenance and testing name
09:05
for the generator is normally limited to
09:07
inspection and lubrication of bearings
09:10
according to manufacturers
09:12
recommendation clean the generators in
09:15
case of dirt in accordance with the
09:17
manufacturers recommendation it is
09:19
rendered that you check the generators
09:22
controlled equipment and compare them to
09:25
the test protocols delivered from the
09:28
manufacturer Limited maintenance is
09:33
generally all that is necessary in the
09:35
main switchboard however specified
09:39
maintenance on the different
09:40
manufacturers should be carried out
09:42
generally the maintenance on a main
09:46
switchboard consists of cleaning
09:48
lubrication of mechanical devices and
09:51
checking contacts note that unnecessary
09:54
tightening of contacts and terminals are
09:57
not recommended this may cause
10:01
deformations and in turn break or weaken
10:04
contacts some circuit breakers may have
10:07
pneumatic delay relays which tend to
10:10
change delay time due to dirt these have
10:14
to be cleaned and checked eventually
10:17
readjusted inspection of the instruments
10:20
accuracy may be carried out according to
10:22
maintenance schedule inspect the
10:25
generator circuit breakers in accordance
10:28
of manufacturers recommendations typical
10:34
failure on the generator may be one or
10:36
more of the following
