familiarize you with how alternate
00:23
current appear the one phase generator
00:27
the three phase generator armature
00:30
reaction it has been said if a winding
00:37
is repeated inhomogeneous magnetic field
00:40
voltage will be induced Faraday's law
00:43
states that the induced voltage equals
00:47
change of flux divided by the time
00:50
factor which means that the rate of flux
00:53
change determines the strength of
00:56
voltage
00:59
what if Lex flux can be described as a
01:09
magnetic field which crosses the winding
01:12
as we can see if this position the
01:16
maximum magnetic field crosses the
01:18
winding which means maximum flex let us
01:31
rotate the winding and see what happens
01:55
according to the holidays law the
01:58
induced voltage will be at a minimum
02:00
when the Flex crossing the winding is at
02:03
maximum because the way to flex change
02:07
if a communion as we can see the induced
02:15
voltage is at its highest when the flux
02:17
that it lowest which in turn illustrates
02:21
that when the flux is at its lowest the
02:23
induced voltage gotta tyas the flux line
02:27
follow the finest curve form
02:40
what we've seen so far is a simple
02:43
generator in which the windings have
02:47
been turned and the induced voltage must
02:49
be extracted via the slip rings and
02:52
brushes generators have their windings
02:56
mounted the armature and the magnetic
02:59
field does the rotating
03:20
as you can see because the relative
03:22
movement between the winding the
03:24
magnetic field that produces the voltage
03:27
as long as the magnetic field crosses
03:31
the windings voltage will be induced in
03:34
the windings note a stronger magnetic
03:39
field that is more field lines which
03:43
give a higher rate of flux change
03:45
results in higher voltage which
03:53
what we have now is very simplified one
03:58
phase generator with two poles in order
04:03
to achieve a frequency of 60 Hertz we
04:06
must rotate the magnet the speed of 3600
04:09
RPM the rotational speed can be found by
04:14
using the formula below the frequency
04:17
equals the number of pole pairs on the
04:20
rotor times the number of rotations per
04:25
minute RPM / 60 so in order to have a
04:31
speed of 60 Hertz with a two-pole
04:34
generator the equation will look like
04:37
this
04:49
in this module we will use the diesel
04:52
engine with 1200 RPM 60 hertz at the
04:57
primary mover for the alternator
05:21
ok
05:29
practically all generators are designed
05:34
as three phase generators 23 winding
05:39
sets mounted with a hunting 20 degrees
05:42
phase shift around the stata this will
05:46
give the three phases with the induced
05:48
voltage a shift of hunting 20 degrees in
05:52
relation to each other we want to
05:58
utilize the armature in order to create
06:01
a three-phase system so we provide the
06:05
generator with two extra sets of
06:07
windings and a 4-pole magnet on the
06:10
rotor
06:18
the windings not be mounted in such a
06:24
way that each winding have its wine Dane
06:27
side over both the North and the South
06:30
Poles at the same time we will now add
06:34
the other two phases by adding two more
06:36
winding the armature if we study this
06:42
generator doing one revolution we will
06:46
see that the generator will produce to
06:48
set the sinus curves instead of one
06:51
that's the two poles one winding
06:54
generator
06:55
this means that the prime mover for
07:00
example of these legend can run at half
07:03
speed and still produce a constant 60
07:07
Hertz in this section we'll take a
07:13
closer look at how different types of
07:15
loads affect the generator we will use
07:19
the 4-pole generator as an example
07:27
no load is connected to the generator no
07:31
current will be present in the generator
07:33
armature this means that there are no
07:37
magnetic fields around the windings
07:40

be at its maximum as you'll see in the

the arrows refer to the right-hand rule
08:54
as we know a current through an ohmic

09:13

09:38
passed maximum negative voltage and is
09:41

09:45
connected to an ohmic load current will
09:48
flow through the windings which is

09:57
position shown the voltage clean
10:00
terminal has passed 0 and it's
10:03
approaching maximum negative voltage
10:05
since the generator is connected to an
10:09
atomic load a current will flow through
10:11
the windings which is in phase with the
10:14
bold pitch after the rotor position
10:21
shown voltage to the blue terminal is at
10:25
its maximum since the generators
10:29
connected to an all make load they will
10:32

10:34
is in phase with the voltage according
10:37
to the right-hand rule magnetic fields
10:40
will appear around the windings shown
10:43
let's take a closer look at how these
10:50
small magnetic fields around the
10:53
windings affect the main field as we can
10:57
see we have a magnetic field in the
10:59
armature which crosses the main field
11:07
at the inductive load connected to the
11:11
terminals the current through the
11:14
armature windings is 90 degrees phase
11:16
shifted after the induced voltage why
11:24
let's take a look at Lenz law men's laws
11:30
state that a change of current in a
11:33
conductor or winding would induce a
11:36
voltage which would resist the change of
11:39
current that caused it to be able to
11:42
drive the current through the coil the
11:44
generator have to deliver a voltage
11:47
equal to the induced voltage in the
11:49
winding that in opposite direction and
11:53
alternate current in the winding would
11:55
make a flux and phase of the current the
11:59
flux change would induce a voltage 90

section
12:19
Joseph since no load is connected to the
12:22
generator no current will be present in

the generator armature this means that
12:30

15:26
magnetic field would appear around the

windings shown let's take a closer look
15:35
at how these small magnetic fields
15:38
around the windings affect the main
15:41
field as we can see we have a magnetic
15:44
field in the armature which crosses the

green terminal or just fast 0 and is
17:51
approaching max in a negative voltage at
17:58
the rotor position shown voltage to the
18:01
blue terminal will be at maximum because
18:06
of the phase shift due to the inductive
18:09
load the current will be a Dominion and
18:13
as a result will not have any magnetic
18:16
field around these windings let's take a
18:22
closer look to how these small magnetic
18:25
fields around the windings affect the
18:29
main field a frequency by direction of
18:34
the magnetic field around the windings
18:36
will form a magnetic field with opposing
18:40
direction to the main field the main
18:44
field will be weakened and by this the
18:47
induced voltage will be lower than the

active load connected to the terminals
19:00
the Covenant throughout the armature
19:02
windings will be phase shifted 90
19:06
degrees in front of the voltage why the
19:14
capacitor can be considered short
19:16
circuited at the time when there is no
19:19
load and no voltage in the circuit so
19:23
the more we can be with a capacitor as
19:26
being fully restricted or endless
19:30
resistance when the capacitor is fully
19:34
charged from this we can imagine that
19:37
the Covenant will be at its maximum when
19:40
the voltage crosses zero on the finest
19:42
curve and at minimum when the voltage is
19:47
at its maximum out maximum supply
19:50
voltage the capacitor is fully charged
19:54
and therefore it will also have a
19:56
voltage equal to the supply voltage but
20:00
in an opposite direction conclusion
20:04
since the capacitor can be considered a
20:07
short circuited when supply voltage
20:09
crosses evil the current has to be at
20:13
its maximum value and other result by 90

how the sum of all the magnetic field
20:28

20:33
field after the rotor positions
20:40
home the voltage of the red terminal has
20:43
just cast maximum negative voltage and
20:47
is approaching zero because of the phase
20:51

shown after the rotor position show
21:00
devoted to the green terminal has just

21:14
position shown after the rotor position
21:19
show the bold clear to the duel terminal
21:22
will be at its maximum because of the
21:25
phase shift due to the capacitive load
21:28
the current will be active minimun and
21:32
as a result have no magnetic fields
21:35
around these windings let's take a
21:42
closer look and how these small magnetic
21:45
fields around the windings affect the
21:49
main fields as we can see the direction
21:52
of the magnetic fields around the
21:54
windings will form a magnetic field for
21:58
the same direction as the main field the
22:02
main field is strengthened and this
22:05
would increase the induced voltage
22:07
asking if
22:14
mean the induced voltage and the
22:16
terminal voltage are dependent on the
22:19
type of those connected to generate
22:22
