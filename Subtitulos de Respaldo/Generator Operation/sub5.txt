In this section you will learn how to
00:22
synchronize an incoming generator to
00:25
alive the spa the following conditions
00:30
must be present before parallel
00:32
connection is carried out the generator
00:35
and the main bus bar must have voltage
00:38
similarity the generator and the main
00:41
burst bar must have frequency similarity
00:44
the generator and the main burst bar
00:46
must be synchronized the voltage is read
00:51
between the main burst bars and the
00:53
incoming generator the instruments are
00:57
found in a synchronizing section of the
00:59
main switchboard the frequency is read
01:05
between the main bus bars on the
01:06
incoming generator the instruments are
01:10
found in the synchronizing section on
01:13
the main switchboard synchronism is read
01:17
by means of the synchronizing lamp and
01:20
the synchro scope the instruments are
01:23
found in a synchronizing section the
01:25
main switchboard the synchro scope is
01:31
the main synchronizing instrument the
01:34
synchronizing lamps can be considered to
01:37
be a backup for the finca scope both the
01:40
synchro scope which consists of a number
01:42
of LEDs and the synchronizing lamps are
01:45
based on the same principle there are
01:51
different ways of connecting the
01:53
synchronizing lamps but we've connected
01:55
them in a dark bright combination and
01:58
place the lamp in a triangle which gives
02:00
a rotation effect the lamps are arranged
02:04
so that h 1 and h 3 will be lit while
02:08
hate to is dark when the generator and
02:11
best are synchronized if the generator
02:16
frequencies too fast relative to the
02:18
main bus the synchronizing lamp rotation
02:21
would be clockwise when the
02:26
of frequencies too slow relative of the
02:29
main bus the synchronizing lamp rotation
02:32
will be counterclockwise the connection
02:37
of a generator breaker should be
02:39
executed when the lamps are in the five
02:42
to twelve position with a generator
02:45
frequency slightly above the bus
02:48
frequency clockwise the reason the
02:52
generator frequency should be slightly
02:54
above the bus frequency is because the
02:57
generator will be taking on a load the
02:59
moment that it is connected by not doing
03:03
this we risk reverse power with a
03:06
subsequent tripping of the generator
03:08
beaker let's start the generator by
03:13
pushing the start button if the voltage
03:16
for any reason is different from you
03:18
nominal adjustment of excitation may be
03:22
necessary the generator frequency is too
03:32
low increase the speed by pressing the
03:35
UP button connect the bus and generator
03:39
at synchronization
