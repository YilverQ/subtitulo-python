Completion this chapter the student
00:23
should appreciate the need for the
00:24
different instruments and switch gears
00:27
normally found on main switch boards and
00:30
have the necessary theoretical knowledge
00:32
to operate the main switchboard the main
00:38
switchboard is probably the most obvious
00:40
element the electrical power plant the
00:45
main switchboard is the main control
00:47
center for the electrical power plant in
00:53
addition to the monitoring control and
00:55
protection equipment for the generator
00:57
sets the NSB D supplies power to motor
01:03
group starter boards section boards and
01:06
distribution boards let's have a closer
01:11
look at the instrumentation and control
01:14
equipment on a typical switchboard click
01:19
on the switchboard section for a better
01:21
look
01:41
point and click on the DG sections and
02:11
the synchronizing sections to have a
02:13
look inside for details about the
02:19
generator breaker the protection devices
02:21
point and click on the breaker symbol
02:24
move the cursor over the object for
02:29
descriptions for details about the
02:38
generator break point and click DG one
02:42
is running and connected to the main bus
02:44
spa start DG to select the generator to
02:50
be synchronized by means of selector
02:52
switch the frequency and voltage should
03:00
be adjusted if necessary
03:13
press the in button and a synchro scope
03:19
within the five to twelve position while
03:23
the adjusting of frequency of voltage is
03:26
not very demanding on personnel the
03:29
parallel connection of two generators
03:31
requires trained personnel to help
03:35
personnel do to perform a parallel
03:37
connection a semi-auto synchronizing
03:40
device is often included this is a
03:44
parallel connection relay also called
03:48
check synchronizer which gives a connect
03:51
signal to the main breaker when voltage
03:54
frequency and phase for the incoming
03:58
generator are within preset limits dg1
04:05
is running and connected to the main bus
04:07
bar start DG to select the generator to
04:14
be synchronized by means of the selector
04:16
switch press the corresponding button
04:20
for semi-auto synchronization if
04:24
necessary adjust the frequency and
04:26
voltage until the ready lamp is lit the
04:30
ready lamp indicates whether or not the
04:33
voltage and frequency are within
04:35
acceptable limits for connection
04:49
In button if the circuit breaker does
04:54
not connect you may have to tweak the
04:56
frequency refer to the synchro scope to
05:01
determine what adjustments are necessary
05:03
