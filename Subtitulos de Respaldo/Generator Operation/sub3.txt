This section will familiarize you with
00:22
voltage regulation the one phase
00:25
generator the three phase generator as
00:32
we've seen so far in a section the
00:35
induced voltage and therefore the
00:37
terminal voltage is dependent on the
00:40
type of load connected to the generator
00:42
terminals to maintain the terminal
00:47
voltage within acceptable limits due to
00:50
load change on the generator we need to
00:53
vary the strength the main field the
00:58
curves show the relationship between
01:01
terminal voltage and current at constant
01:04
magnetism it is evident that an
01:08
inductive load demands the largest
01:11
voltage regulation however the different
01:15
consumers onboard a typical ship consist
01:18
of both ohmic inductive and capacitive
01:21
loads in which the total power factor on
01:26
the generators is normally between 0.8
01:29
and 0.9 there are many voltage
01:35
regulators on the market and the way in
01:38
which an automatic voltage control or
01:41
AVR for short controls the excitation
01:46
varies from model to model in this
01:50
section we will have a look the
01:52
principles for the following two types
01:54
the brush slip ring generator even
01:59
though it is not found on board modern
02:01
vessels today all voltage regulators are
02:04
based upon the same principle and can
02:07
therefore be considered an introduction
02:10
to the modern brushless automatic
02:12
excitation systems the brushless
02:15
generator with current compounding
02:18
transformers and electronic control unit
02:22
when the road
02:27
starts turning low voltage will be
02:30
induced because magnetic remanence in
02:33
the rotor this small voltage passes the
02:37
current limiter and the primary winding
02:40
P to the magnitude around p 2 with
02:46
induced current in s the current limiter
02:51
and the condensate a battery is turned
02:55
to resonance at nominal frequency and a
02:58
current through the circuit in resonance
03:00
is tuned to the nominal terminal voltage
03:04
as you can read from the formulas and
03:09
the illustrations the impedance will
03:12
decrease and the current will increase
03:14
until 60 Hertz achieved the circuit is
03:20
tuned to give a sufficient excitation
03:22
current to maintain 440 volts at nominal
03:27
frequency as we remember a reactive load
03:33
will weaken the main field in a
03:35
generator the regulator has to
03:39
compensate for this by strengthening the
03:42
magnetization this will automatically be
03:48
taken care of by means of the primary
03:51
winding p1 as soon as a generator is
03:55
loaded a current will flow in the
03:58
primary windings which we induce voltage
04:01
the magnetic field in p1 induces an
04:07
extra current in the secondary winding s
04:10
therefore the magnetism current is load
04:15
dependent although the above principle
04:21
is ingenious due to its simplicity it
04:24
does have disadvantages brushes and slip
04:28
rings cause attentiveness due to wear
04:30
and dirt it is difficult to adjust
04:33
nominal voltage the voltage is to a
04:37
certain degree dependent on the power
04:39
factor on
04:40
loads and the prime movers rotational
04:44
speed the modern voltage regulator
04:48
systems have the excitation equipment
04:51
mounted directly on the generator shaft
04:54
let us have a closer look at a typical
04:58
voltage regulator system found on board
05:02
a ship today we have removed the
05:04
capacitor bank from this system some
05:09
manufacturers do this to prevent the
05:11
variation of feel resistance and thereby
05:14
affect the component current caused by
05:17
temperature variations the brushless
05:24
generator has its own excitation
05:27
generator mounted directly on the
05:30
generator shaft the rectifier and the
05:35
excitation machines armature windings a
05:38
part of the generators rotating parts
05:41
the excitation winding of the excitation
05:47
machine represent the stator the
05:51
response time is a little slower than
05:53
the brush slip ring generator without
05:57
AVR because it is more component in a
06:02
system which delay the response but does
06:06
not have the disadvantages mentioned
06:09
under the brush slip ring system voltage
06:13
between in the terminals caused by the
06:16
remanent in the rotor the star connected
06:20
reactor coil l2 can be viewed upon at a
06:25
small internal load in the generator the
06:31
inductive current which appears in the
06:33
reactor coil will flow through the
06:36
primary windings t1 this current induces
06:42
a current in the secondary windings s
06:44
the alternate
06:48
is then directed in a three phase diode
06:51
bridge v2 a directed excitation current
06:56
will flow from v2 through the excitation
07:00
winding l1 by strengthening the
07:05
magnetization field we will induce
07:08
voltage in a stator of the excitation
07:11
machine this voltage is then directed
07:15
through the diode bridge v3 and fed into
07:21
the synchronous generators excitation
07:23
winding me all the voltage regulator
07:29
system found on board are designed in
07:33
such a way that the regulators control
07:36
the voltage down in proportion to the n
07:38
regulated voltage unregulated voltage
07:43
would arise to approximately hundred
07:46
twenty percent of nominal voltage if the
07:49
regulator or Sai rishta were removed
07:53
this over compensation is damned to
08:00
achieve as quick a regulation as
08:02
possible during connection to large
08:05
consumers let's see what happens when we
08:08
start the generator as we can see the
08:23
actual value equals the setpoint what
08:26
happens on the actual value is greater
08:28
than the set point when the actual
08:36
it is grated moset point the comparator
08:40
in the regulator gives an output to the
08:43
thyristor gate which opens by rishta the
08:47
positive half of the phase in the middle
08:50
will be shunted by the open PI rishta
08:52
and reduce the output from the rectifier
08:56
bridge the firing angle of the fire
08:59
rishta is determined by the setpoint
09:02
actual value deviation after to the main
09:22
breaker applying a load to the generator
09:25
the primary winding will come into
09:28
action as well as a static voltage
09:31
regulator connect the breaker through
09:34
the push-button because of the old
09:45
impound station ug will be greater than
09:48
UN and the thyristor will open to limit
09:53
the excitation the regulator is
10:05
necessary to ensure equal excitation
10:08
current to the generators which will
10:11
ensure equal load sharing this was not
10:16
necessary for the brush slip ring
10:18
generators as the magnetization windings
10:22
were accessible but we could parallel
10:25
the excitation current wires to avoid an
10:28
equal load sharing our
10:35
r 2 and the electronic circuit arielle
10:38
can be viewed upon a 30 make resistances
10:42
with individual voltage drops UT 1
10:49
represents the actual voltage at
10:54
increasing load the UT one voltage will
10:58
drop and the voltage over the resistors
11:01
will change proportionally as you
11:06
arielle changes in proportion with a
11:09
terminal voltage this value is used of
11:13
the actual value for the comparator the
11:17
actual value is compared to the setpoint
11:20
the result of the comparison is
11:24
amplified the output from the amplifier
11:29
is divided into pulses which switches a
11:32
thyristor on and off the size of the
11:37
Purser's depends on the deviation note
11:41
that the tire wrister works against the
11:43
magnetism which means that when you g is
11:47
less than un the limitation of
11:50
excitation current stops this means that
11:54
the thyristor is blocked note that the
11:57
resistance r1 is adjusted to a lower
12:01
value the voltage will decrease over r1
12:05
and respectively increase over arielle
12:09
this will cause the actual value in the
12:13
set point to be equal at a lower
12:16
terminal voltage to achieve equal
12:22
excitation current at all loads at
12:25
parallel operation we have to provide
12:28
the regulator with a current transformer
12:31
as we will see in the following pages
12:33
the current transformer is a crucial
12:36
component required to achieve the
12:39
voltage droop this is necessary for a
12:43
stable reactive load sharing the
12:47
regulator
12:48
earlier show is only for single
12:51
generator installations when the
12:58
generator runs diagonal or not connected
13:01
no current is present for the p2 are two
13:05
circuit when the generators canna taking
13:12
load a current will flow in the t2 are
13:16
two circuit which will have another
13:19
direction depending on the power factor
13:21
for an increasing load the voltage over
13:26
r2 will decrease shown as a resulting
13:30
you are too in the pop-up the voltage
13:34
drop over arielle will increase slightly
13:38
due to this let us start the generator
13:43
the generator is now running at idle as
13:52
we can see there is no current present
13:56
in the UT to our to circuit let us
14:00
connect the generator as we can see from
14:09
the bow
14:10
droop pop up the actual voltage is four
14:14
percent lower and the set point voltage
14:16
the comparator compares the actual
14:25
voltage with the set point voltage the
14:28
result of the comparison gives an output
14:31
to the thigh rishta which will parallel
14:34
shift the droop until you g equals um if
14:43
the power factor increases the voltage
14:46
over r2 decreases and the output from
14:50
arielle increases ug exceeds UN and the
14:56
comparator will give an output to fire
14:59
rishta which would open it to limit the
15:02
excitation current until you g equals um
15:06
let's see what happens when we reduce
15:15
the load to eighty percent the
15:20
comparator reads that you g is greater
15:22
than un and will give an output which
15:26
will parallel shift the droop until you
15:29
g equals un note for a single generator
15:36
the current transformer is not necessary
15:39
because the generator takes the entire
15:41
load anyway and therefore the
15:45
manufacturers have a switch which
15:48
disconnects the current transformer wide
15:51
and single operation the regulator then
15:55
regulates in relation to voltage alone
15:57
let us add another generator to the best
16:02
spa in order to share the load press the
16:08
start dg2 button
16:16
press the contagion a two-button note as
16:21
soon as dg2 takes load the load on DG 1
16:24
will be reduced ug will therefore be
16:28
greater than UN and the fire is still
16:30
open the regulators on DG 1 and dg2 will
16:36
then decrease and increase the load on
16:39
the generators until they are balanced
16:42
to ensure equal load sharing at all
16:49
loads fiddling with a regulator
16:51
components is not recommended we will
16:55
now take a closer look at possible
16:56
effects of such tampering if we increase
17:02
our one on DG 1 during parallel
17:05
operation the output from arielle will
17:09
then decrease the regulator believes for
17:13
the you g is greater than un the
17:16
comparator output will cause an
17:18
increased excitation current the
17:21
generator will then take a large part of
17:23
the reactive load as you can see
17:35
characteristic dg2 would take a larger
17:38
part of the load if we change the
17:41
voltage droop on DG one to eight percent
17:45
during parallel operation the complete
17:50
AVR circuitry is very complex and
17:53
includes a few preset variable resistors
17:57
for the control of sensitivity offset
18:00
error and stability these are adjusted
18:05
and set during the generator trials to
18:09
achieve an optimum and stable
18:11
performance it is strongly recommended
18:13
that you do not tamper with such preset
18:17
resistors r1 which is found in the main
18:20
switchboard should only be adjusted as
18:23
an exception in order to define
18:26
adjustments to the generator voltage
18:29
when it is idle in the following pages
