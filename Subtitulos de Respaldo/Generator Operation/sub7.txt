In this section you will learn the benefits of
00:22
using a power management system they're
00:27
closed today may have a number of
00:28
generator sets split best bars and a
00:32
variable load automatic control of all
00:36
these have become common practice to
00:38
ensure continuity of service and an
00:41
efficient management of both generating
00:44
and load equipment typical power
00:48
management system will incorporate the
00:51
following functions automatic line
00:54
frequency adjustment load monitoring
00:57
load dependent start/stop of generator
01:02
sets supervision of heavy consumers
01:05
switch on load sharing automatic start
01:09
and connect after blackout other
01:12
functions which may be controlled by the
01:14
power management system include control
01:17
of pre lubrication pumps on the standby
01:20
Diesel's automatic load dependent change
01:24

01:33
item to have that item described to you
01:35
in greater detail the power management
01:38
system sends increase/decrease signals
01:41
to the governor without the power
01:45
management system fine adjustment for
01:48
the frequency has to be executed
01:50
manually by means or the apt down
01:53
switches on the main switchboard the
02:00
total system load is monitored and
02:02
compared to the available online
02:04
generating capacity the system's will
02:08
advise the operator to start off stop
02:11
the generator sets in auto mode this
02:16
will be carried out automatically the
02:22
total system load is monitored and
02:24
compared with the available online
02:27
generating capacity
02:30
the system would advise the operator to
02:33
start stop the generator sets in
02:36
response to varying load in auto mode
02:41
this will be carried out automatically
02:43
the power management system will
02:49
consider the total load in relation to
02:52
the available online capacity before
02:55
allowing the heavy consumer to start
02:58
this is them to prevent blackout if the
03:03
actual old and a heavy consumer load
03:06
totaled is greater than the available
03:09
online capacity the power management
03:12
system would start and connect the next
03:16
generator before the heavy consumer is
03:18
allowed to be switched on the blackout
03:23
logic is triggered when the power
03:25
management system reads zero volts from
03:28
the main burst bars the highest priority
03:31
generator would attempt to start and
03:34
connect to the main bus bars if this
03:37
fails the next diesel generator will try
03:40
to start and connect move the cursor
03:44
over the different push buttons and
03:47
indicators for a description
03:59
let us assume that one generator is
04:24
connected and the other one is ready
04:26
both generators are in auto and are set
04:30
to equal load sharing you can now
04:32
increase and decrease the load on the
04:35
generators and change from equal load to
04:38
optimal load when finished press the
04:41
continue button by now it should be
04:49
obvious but to achieve maximum safety
04:52
during maneuvering both generators
04:55
should be connected and equal load
04:57
sharing selected as a control mode note
05:02
that even if the Prince of the same
05:04
there are several types of power
05:06
management systems found on the market
05:08
so you must always familiarize yourself
05:12
with the actual system found on board
05:15
your ship
