A modern marine electrical power plant is a very
00:23
complex system which demands trained
00:27
personnel to ensure safe and economical
00:30
operation we can consider the electrical
00:35
power plant as the heart of the ship if
00:39
the heart stops the ship will out of
00:42
control and may cause an accident that
00:46
could possibly lead to fatal
00:47
consequences electrical power plants can
00:51
vary from small plants with one
00:53
generator to large complex systems
00:56
consisting of federal generators with
00:59
various types of prime movers such as
01:03
diesel engines steam turbines gas
01:07
turbines and a main shaft the electrical
01:13
power plant we will take a closer look
01:15
at is fairly simple but the electrical
01:19
principles to fill the same
01:24
the name gold
01:26
aren't you is to provide you with the
01:29
necessary knowledge the working
01:31
principles for both generators and
01:34
related equipment in addition it would
01:38
give you an appreciation of the need for
01:41
power management systems even though
01:45
there are several different designs of
01:47
electrical power plants the principles
01:50
described in this module a common for
01:52
most systems finally it could teach you
01:56
the importance of following safety
01:58
procedures while working on electrical
02:01
installations at the beginning of this
02:03
module will be a review of basic
02:06
electric principles before entering into
02:08
more complex subjects
02:11
good luck
