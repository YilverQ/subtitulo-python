Completion of this section the student
00:22
should have a good understanding of how
00:24
power is produced and a mutuality
00:27
between the prime movers and the
00:29
alternator's a pre-requisite for
00:34
satisfactory parallel operation is equal
00:38
speed on the prime movers Diesel's the
00:43
speed of the diesel engines is
00:44
controlled by their governors there are
00:47
different types of controllers on the
00:49
market but the principle is the same the
00:53
purpose of the controllers is to
00:55
maintain the speed at all loads and for
00:58
load sharing of active load in the
01:01
example below the generator use is a six
01:05
pole generator and the nominal frequency
01:08
is 60 Hertz this means that the speed of
01:12
the diesel engine has to be 1,200 rpm if
01:19
a kilowatt load such as heating is
01:21
switched on to the alternator then
01:24
energy is drawn from the alternator and
01:26
converted into heat this energy must be
01:30
provided by increasing the rate of fuel
01:33
to the prime mover this happens
01:36
automatically in the following way
01:52
as for the voltage regulation reactive
02:13
load sharing the diviners are adjusted
02:16
to have a speed drop from zero to full
02:20
load as we can see in the characteristic
02:28
the RPMs have dropped to 1152 of the
02:33
ends at full load if the idle speed is
02:36
set to 1,200 rpm and the speed droop is
02:40
four percent the frequency will drop
02:44
proportionally with a speed 250 7.6
02:48
hurts let's parallel shift the droop so
02:52
that the generator is at its nominal
02:54
speed at fifty percent load this is done
02:58
by changing the speed set point as we
03:05
can see the RPM is at 1200 rpms at fifty
03:10
percent load and the frequency will be
03:13
60 Hertz let's see what happens when we
03:16
change the speed roop to two percent we
03:20
still wish to retain the nominal
03:22
frequency at fifty percent slowed to
03:29
obtain a nominal frequency fifty percent
03:31
load we also have to change the speed
03:34
set point let's keep the focus and group
03:43
setting
03:44
and the governor adjusted nominal
03:46
frequency 60 Hertz at fifty percent load
03:49
start the generator by pressing the
03:57
start button on the DG one control panel
04:00
as you can see the generator has reached
04:06
idle speed connect the generator by
04:09
pressing the connect button on the DG
04:11
one control panel load the generator to
04:18
fifty percent each click on the increase
04:22
or decrease button will change the load
04:25
by ten percent as you can see we have
04:39
nominal frequency at fifty percent load
04:42
continue to load the generator two
04:44
hundred percent the RPM and frequency is
04:54
at 1176 and 58.8 respectively at full
05:01
load to maintain the nominal frequency
05:04
we must add more fuel to the diesel by
05:07
the means of the governor press the up
05:10
button on the governor we want to
05:17
connect generator 2 to the main bus in
05:20
order to share the load the governor has
05:24
the same speed droop characteristic as
05:26
number one start dg2 by pressing the
05:30
start button in the dg2 control panel
05:33
adjust the frequency of dg2 and it is
05:37
slightly above the main bus frequency by
05:41
pressing the down button the frequency
05:45
for the incoming connects dg2 by
05:48
pressing the connect button in the dg2
05:50
control panel the main best frequency
05:53
will decrease if we do not decrease DG
05:57
one simultaneously let's adjust both the
06:02
governor's to the nominal frequency at
06:10
this point it should be obvious what
06:13
will happen if we tamper with a speed
06:15
group and speed setting let's have a
06:18
look at a few examples changing the
06:23
speed set point Edwards on DG one will
06:27
result in DG one taking more of the
06:29
total load than dg2 there will be a
06:32
constant load deviation between DG 1 and
06:36
dg2 changing the speed droop on governor
06:41
one to eight percent will cause DG one
06:45
to take half as much load 50g to hear
06:51
both the speed setpoint and speed droop
06:54
is changed on DG one with these new
06:58
settings we get balanced load sharing
07:01
only at fifty percent load note that
07:07
these settings have been adjusted doing
07:09
the generator trials and should not be
07:12
tampered with if you are not fully aware
07:15
of what you are doing note that on
07:17
modern electrical power plants there is
07:20
an automatic frequency controls which
07:22
have take the Devon as app down
07:24
according to a preset point the
07:27
procedures in this chapter of a manual
07:30
