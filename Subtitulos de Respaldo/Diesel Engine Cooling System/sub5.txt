After completing this chapter the learner will know the maintenance
00:03
requirements of a diesel engine cooling system now the reasons for using
00:08
chemical treatment in a diesel engine cooling system know the basic principles
00:12
of how chemical treatment protects the system
00:35
when a diesel engine cooling system is operated with good quality water which
00:40
is correctly treated then maintenance is minimal and the system should give long
00:44
term operation with few problems lack of or inadequate treatment will lead to
00:51
scale deposits and corrosion of the system components which may result in
00:55
failure or overheating the only general maintenance required is to keep the
01:00
coolant levels topped up and to maintain the correct concentration of treatment
01:04
in the system care must be taken when draining the system containing treatment
01:08
chemicals as they may pose a pollution risk disposal should be in accordance
01:13
with the material safety data sheet and any marple requirements the system
01:19
components such as the pumps and heat exchangers will require periodic
01:23
maintenance to ensure satisfactory performance circulating pump impellers
01:28
and sealing rings often referred to as wear rings shaft bearings and shafts
01:33
seals will need to be replaced periodically in accordance with
01:37
manufacturer's instructions it may also be necessary
01:40
to clear debris from impellers occasionally heat exchangers may need to
01:45
be manually or chemically cleaned periodically with seals and anodes being
01:50
replaced as required system valves will also require periodic overhaul including
01:56
reconditioning of seat phases and repacking of glands the quality of the
02:01
fresh water used for the first charge and topping up is critical for good
02:05
performance of the system normally the water will be produced on board in the
02:10
freshwater generator and should be good quality there should therefore be very
02:15
low levels of dissolved solids in the water so scale formation should not be a
02:19
problem the water will still require treatment to bring the alkalinity to a
02:25
suitable level to prevent corrosion in the system this will be achieved by the
02:29
correct concentration of a suitable water treatment it should be noted that
02:34
any of the treatments which are normally soluble in the water will actually cause
02:38
the total dissolved solids content of the water to increase excess
02:43
concentrations will therefore lead to possible deposit
02:46
the heat transfers surfaces which can cause overheating due to the insulating
02:51
effect as has been stated the quality of the water in the cooling system dictates
02:56
how well the system will perform even with good quality water the system still
03:02
needs to be treated to prevent scale and corrosion there are many different
03:06
treatments available which are usually corrosion inhibitors and all scale
03:11
preventers most treatments also have some antifreeze component to give low
03:16
temperature protection by lowering the freezing point of the coolant there is
03:21
also a need to protect against cavitation erosion particularly on
03:25
cylinder liners you can click on the button to learn more about cavitation
03:30
erosion when you have finished this page the actual treatment required for a
03:34
particular system is dependant to a large extent on the materials used in
03:39
the system some treatments do not protect certain materials and in fact
03:44
can accelerate the rate of corrosion when used with them most treatments are
03:49
therefore combinations of different chemicals which give protection to the
03:52
system as a whole you may be surprised to know that many of the treatment
03:56
chemicals nitrate and nitrite based for example give protection against
04:01
corrosion by forming passive scale coatings on the metal surfaces which act
04:06
as a protective film against further corrosive attack since these protective
04:11
films are very thin there is only minor insulating effect and heat transfer is
04:16
hardly affected cavitation erosion is a particular problem with wet cylinder
04:21
liners damaged caused by this mechanism can lead to corrosion problems on the
04:27
water side of the line of wall as the piston moves up and down in the cylinder
04:31
liner during the cycle the pressure in the cylinder varies the area of the
04:36
liner at which side thrusts from the piston acts' also varies this variation
04:42
in pressure and thrust causes the line of wool to vibrate this vibration causes
04:47
the line of wool to move in and out affecting the volume in the water space
04:52
this leads to local pressure variations on the water side of the liner as the
04:57
liner wall moves in toward the center pressure on the wet side of the line of
05:01
Walled reduces and vapor bubbles form as the line of wool moves back out it
05:07
creates rapid increase in local pressure which causes the vapor bubbles to
05:11
collapse the collapsing bubbles allow the water to impact on the liner with
05:16
great force this action can break down the protective films formed by the water
05:21
treatment and erode the liner metal the damaged areas are then subject to a high
05:26
risk of corrosion traditionally the chemical composition of cooling water
05:30
treatment was either chromate or nitrate bore rate based often with the addition
05:36
of silicates the treatments commonly used today include so called
05:40
supplemental cooling additives SC A's these are complex compounds of soluble
05:47
chemicals which provide good corrosion protection for a wide range of materials
05:52
as well as scale prevention they often use some of the traditional treatments
05:57
combined with other additives such as molybdate sand phosphates another
06:02
traditional treatment is soluble oil another group of treatments are referred
06:06
to as organic acid technology but we will not consider these here as they are
06:10
not common in marine use we don't need to consider the chemistry in detail but
06:15
you should be aware of the basic way in which the treatments work click on the
06:19
buttons for more information on the most common treatments chromate based
06:23
treatments work by forming a thin film of the surface of the metal components
06:27
in the system this film forms a passive barrier which isolates the metal from
06:32
any oxygen within the system and therefore prevents oxidation and
06:36
corrosion occurring they are often combined with phosphates which help
06:41
maintain the alkalinity of the system chromates will not prevent scale
06:45
formation it should be noted that chromates are highly toxic and are
06:49
calcio genic that is they can lead to cancer chromate based treatments are
06:54
therefore not allowed in systems which are used to heat freshwater generators
06:58
if the product is used as potable water nitrite based treatments work in a
07:03
similar way to chromates in that they form passive protective
07:07
layers to prevent corrosion the borate component acts to maintain
07:11
alkalinity are often included in the treatment to
07:15
improve protection of aluminium components in the system nitrites can
07:19
give rise to microbial problems and the treatment compound often includes a
07:24
biocide soluble oil when used in the correct concentration gives corrosion
07:29
protection by forming a thin film over the metal surfaces soluble oil will not
07:34
prevent scale formation as with the other treatments considered in this
07:38
module if the protective layer formed by the
07:41
treatment breaks down then concentrated pitting corrosion will result you should
07:46
always make sure that you are familiar with the content of the materials safety
07:50
data sheets for any chemicals that you have to handle on board the ship
07:54
particular care must be taken with storage personal protective equipment
07:58
requirements and first aid measures the code of safe working practices also
08:04
gives general guidance on handling chemicals many of the cooling water
08:08
system chemicals are alkaline based to ensure a correct condition of the water
08:13
acidity of the water will increase corrosion the concentration of the
08:17
treatment chemicals and cooling water systems can usually be checked by simple
08:22
comparative tests the treatments calls the water to color and the intensity of
08:27
the color measured against a color comparator will give a direct reading of
08:31
the concentration some treatments require the addition of an indicator
08:35
solution to the sample prior to carrying out the comparative tests other test
08:39
methods include the addition of tablets until the sample color changes a
08:43
conversion chart is then used to give the result in parts-per-million
08:48
concentration any inhibitor type treatments which use passive film
08:52
formation to prevent corrosion need to be maintained at the correct
08:56
concentrations if this is not achieved then partial breakdown of the passive
09:01
film can give rise to local anodic areas which will result in severe pitting of
09:06
the metal and lead to early failure of the components excess concentrations of
09:11
soluble oil can form insulating layers on the heat exchange surfaces which may
09:16
lead to overheating of the engine in very high concentrations the soluble oil
09:21
may come out of solution and corrosion protection may be lost altogether the
09:26
quiet constant and dosage instructions for all
09:29
treatments will be given in the material safety data sheet and should be followed
09:33
if adequate protection is to be achieved the sea water solid of the system may be
09:38
treated to minimize or completely avoid marine growth in the pipe work or on the
09:44
seawater side of the heat exchangers the treatment used may either be chemical
09:49
additives or electro chlorination which generates sodium hypochlorite from
09:54
seawater care must be taken to use the treatment in such a way that no damage
09:59
is done to the environment or marine ecology by excessive dosage or
10:03
concentrations you should always refer to the manufacturer's instructions when
10:08
using any treatments corrosion protection can be achieved by fitting
10:12
sacrificial anodes to the end covers of the individual heat exchangers typically
10:18
zinc is used for the anodes as the name suggests the anodes will corrode rather
10:24
than the system metals in this section we have looked at the problems
10:28
associated with cooling water systems and some of the treatments available to
10:32
overcome these problems we have also considered some of the basic corrosion
10:36
mechanisms and seen her of the various treatments act to prevent them you
10:41
should now have an understanding of the treatments and the necessity to maintain
10:44
correct concentrations
