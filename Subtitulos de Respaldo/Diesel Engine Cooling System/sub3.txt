After completing this chapter the learner will know the main components of
00:04
a diesel engine cooling water system know the function of each of the
00:08
components in a diesel engine cooling water system know the basic control
00:12
alarm and safety functions of a diesel engine cooling system
00:36
the illustration shows the main components of a typical basic jacket
00:41
water cooling system we will look at each of the components and identify the
00:45
roles they have within the system we will also look at some of the different
00:49
types that are commonly used you can compare them with the systems on board
00:53
your current vessel most of the cooling water systems that you will come across
00:58
will use some form of electrically driven centrifugal pump as the main flow
01:02
generator for the coolant for many smaller engines the circulating pump
01:06
will be engine driven these pumps which are a type of rotor dynamic pump use a
01:11
rotating impeller to give the fluid kinetic energy by accelerating the fluid
01:16
from the center of the impeller the eye towards the outer edge this kinetic
01:20
energy is converted into static pressure either by using a volute casing or a
01:25
veined diffuser ring and it is this increased pressure which gives the
01:30
system flow many pump designs use a combination of volute casing a diffuser
01:35
to increase the available pressure the system pressure is dictated by the
01:40
discharge head or the height that the pump has to deliver to as a general
01:44
guide pumps with large diameter shallow impellers are used where high pressures
01:49
are required and volume is unimportant while those with smaller diameter deep
01:54
impalas are used where volume is the main concern multistage types using two
02:01
or more impellers in series can be used where higher pressures are required you
02:05
will probably find that most of the centrifugal pumps used in the cooling
02:09
systems on board your vessel are of the single stage type using a combination of
02:14
diffuser ring and volute casing the impellers will be of moderate diameter
02:19
and depth this will give adequate pressure and sufficient flow for most
02:23
systems you should click on the buttons to see how the volute casing and
02:27
diffuser ring work as the fluid enters the center of the impeller the
02:32
centrifugal action causes it to move upwards along the impeller vanes
02:36
accelerating it as it goes the vanes are shaped to assist in driving the fluid
02:42
around and outward while increasing the speed the natural centrifugal action
02:47
adds to the outward radial movement as the fluid leaves the impeller edge it is
02:52
gathered in the volute of the casing as you can see the volute casing is shaped
02:57
to have an increasing cross-section as you move along it towards the pump
03:01
outlet this causes the fluid speed to decrease and the kinetic energy is
03:06
converted into static pressure as the fluid enters the center of the impeller
03:11
the centrifugal action causes it to move upwards along the impeller vanes
03:16
accelerating it as it goes the vanes are shaped to assist in driving the fluid
03:21
around and outwards while increasing the speed for natural centrifugal action
03:26
adds to the output radial movement as the fluid leaves the impeller edge it
03:31
enters the channels between the diffuser ring vanes
03:34
as you can see the diffuser vanes are shaped to have an increasing
03:38
cross-section as you move to the outer end this causes the fluid speed to
03:42
decrease and the kinetic energy is converted into static pressure some
03:47
centrifugal pump designs have both the diffuser ring and the volute casing in
03:52
the same unit the operating principle is similar to that already described but
03:56
higher pressures can be obtained in this arrangement heat exchanges as the name
04:02
suggests are devices designed to allow transfer of heat from one substance to
04:06
another for the cooling systems that we are concerned with this transfer is
04:11
normally from the primary to secondary cooling fluids although there are many
04:15
types of heat exchanger they are generally designed in such a way that a
04:19
barrier is formed to separate the two fluids heat is transferred from the hot
04:23
fluid to the cold fluid by conduction through the barrier mainly by a
04:28
combination of conduction and convection to the cold fluid where air is one of
04:32
the fluids convection and radiation are the main transfer their mechanisms heat
04:37
transfer rates depend on the fluids properties the temperature differentials
04:41
the barrier materials and the type of flow the heat transfer rate can be
04:46
affected by fouling of the fluid contact surfaces and changes to the fluid flow
04:51
heat exchangers can be arranged for parallel flow both fluids traveling in
04:56
the same direction counter flow fluids travel in opposite direction
05:01
or cross flow fluids flowing at right-angles they can also be arranged
05:06
for different flow paths or pulses single paths is where the fluids enter
05:11
at one end to side and flow to the other end or side to exit double paths is
05:18
where the fluids exit at the same end as they enter having passed up and down the
05:22
length of the heat exchanger it is also possible to have other multi pass
05:27
Arrangements the number of pulses is usually achieved by varying the design
05:31
of the end covers plate heat exchangers are now commonly used assist in coolers
05:37
and heaters in a wide variety of marine applications they can be easily adapted
05:42
for different duties and sizes large heat transfer areas can be achieved with
05:47
a relatively compact unit plate heat exchangers consist of a number of thin
05:52
stamped plates supported on a beam frame and clamped between two heavy end plates
05:57
one of the end plates is fixed to the frame and the other the compression
06:02
plate can slide along the frame Tybalt's pulsing through the two end plates are
06:07
used to clamp the assembly together one of the heavy end mates is solid while
06:12
the other is provided with full ports protected against erosion damage with
06:16
rubber inserts for the inlet and outlet of the two fluids the stamped plates are
06:21
formed with corrugations that provide flow paths for the fluids on opposite
06:25
sides of the plates and for holes to match the end plate ports the plates are
06:31
separated and sealed from each other by preformed gaskets in such a way that a
06:35
fluid space is formed between adjacent plates each fluid is admitted to
06:40
alternate spaces in the plate stack so that each plate has one fluid on one
06:45
side and the other fluid on the other side the material used for the plates is
06:49
often stainless steel or titanium which means that the plates are strong and
06:54
resistant to corrosion and erosion while being thin enough to give good heat
06:58
transfer characteristics you will find many designs of shell and tube type heat
07:03
exchangers on the ships that you sail on they are used as heaters or coolers in
07:07
the various systems on board prior to the introduction of plate types these
07:12
for the main form of heat changer used in the marine and general
07:16
engineering applications essentially this type of heat exchanger uses tubes
07:20
to separate the two fluids one flowing through the inside of the tube with the
07:25
other flowing over the outside the tubes are usually arranged as a stack or
07:29
bundle with the open ends fitted into end plates or two plates intermediate
07:35
support plates are often fitted to the stack to prevent distortion and to guide
07:39
fluid flow around the outside of the stack the tubes may be straight with two
07:44
end plates or formed as few tubes with a single end plate sometimes the tubes can
07:50
be formed as spirals or have inserts to affect the nature of the flow to give
07:54
improved efficiency you may have come across some of these such as swirly flow
07:59
tubes which are quite common the tube stack fits into a casing the shell and
08:05
is arranged in such a way that the two plates
08:08
seal against the shell with a stack free to expand at one end the shell is
08:13
provided with connections for inflow and outflow of the fluid that passes over
08:17
the outside of the tubes the final components are the end covers or headers
08:22
these are provided with connections for the fluid that will flow through the
08:26
tubes and also partition webs which direct the flow path and determine the
08:30
number of passes through the heat exchanger roll the mouse over the
08:35
diagram to identify the different components another way of improving the
08:40
heat transfer rate is to increase the surface area in contact with one of the
08:44
fluids this can be achieved by providing fins either on the outside of tubes or
08:50
heat exchanger elements this is common where one of the fluids is either air or
08:54
a gas you will probably have come across this arrangement either with air cooled
08:59
radiators or charged air coolers on diesel engines or with evaporators used
09:04
in the refrigeration plant some diesel engines and air compressors also use
09:10
thinned cylinder blocks to assist the cooling in this way the valves that you
09:15
will find fitted in the cooling systems onboard the vessels you sail on will be
09:19
a mixture of the various types available most common will be manually operated
09:24
types such as gate valves screw valves and screw down non-return valves
09:29
apart from a few specific duties no particular type is right or wrong and
09:34
the valves will be selected by the designer to suit his preference wear a
09:39
cooling system has two circulating pumps which as you will know is very common
09:43
then the discharge side of the pump will require a non-return valve to be fitted
09:48
to prevent backflow from the running pump through the standby pump 3-way
09:52
Valve's fitted for temperature control may also take a number of forms with
09:56
contoured plug types being commonly used we will look at these in detail later in
10:01
this section the purpose of the deaerator
10:05
is to help release any air gases or vapors from the circulating jacket water
10:09
the deaerator is usually a cylindrical shaped tank with a conical top and is
10:15
fitted in the outlet line from the engine positioned at a height greater
10:19
than the engine connections are provided for Inlet and outlet of jacket water and
10:25
also a riser and down comer from the header tank the main Inlet and outlet
10:29
pipes are usually connected to the deaerator
10:32
in such a way that the water rotates around the tank from the upper entry
10:36
point to the lower exit point this rotation helps to release any air gas
10:41
and vapor which then passes through the top riser connection of the deaerator to
10:46
the header tank and out to the atmosphere through the vent pipe the
10:50
header tank or expansion tank as it is also referred to acts as an additional
10:55
volume within the system to accommodate expansion and contraction of the water
10:59
in the system as the temperature rises and falls it also acts as a point of
11:04
exit from the system for any air gas or vapor released in the deaerator
11:09
it has to be positioned high enough in the system to allow for the circulating
11:13
pressure and as such provides a positive suction head for the circulating pump
11:18
filling is usually arranged to be manual so that in case of leakage that
11:23
otherwise might not be easily detected system losses can be monitored by the
11:27
amount of make-up required the material used for the pipe work of cooling
11:32
systems is chosen to give acceptable service life at reasonable cost the
11:37
cooling medium being you is the main factor when choosing the
11:40
material the freshwater side of the system usually incorporates mild steel
11:45
pipe work selected for the low cost of manufacture the pipe work for the
11:49
seawater side of the system is often made from a corrosion resistant alloy
11:53
such as copper nickel or nickel aluminium bronze based materials the
11:58
system drawings on board your ship will give the details of the materials used
12:02
for the different piping systems we have already seen that freshwater is often
12:07
chosen as the coolant in preference to sea water because of the corrosion and
12:11
scale deposits associated with sea water this does not mean that freshwater
12:16
systems are corrosion and scale free freshwater as opposed to distilled water
12:21
still has an appreciable mineral salt content the actual concentration and
12:26
nature of the minerals depends on the source of the freshwater these minerals
12:31
can lead to scale formation and also corrosion particularly at higher
12:36
temperatures in many cases the freshwater produced on board the ship is
12:40
almost pure distilled water with a very low mineral content often less than five
12:45
parts per million measured as chlorides the water is likely to be slightly
12:50
acidic and needs to be treated with chemicals to make it slightly alkaline
12:54
the treatment chemicals are often combined with corrosion inhibitors to
12:59
further protect the system components concentration testing is usually done
13:04
with a simple color comparator we will look at the actual treatments and test
13:08
methods in a later chapter some systems have facility for adding the chemicals
13:12
to the system through a special dosage pot in other systems the treatment is
13:17
added via the header tank in order to monitor the performance of a diesel
13:21
engine and the associated systems it is necessary to have suitable
13:25
instrumentation available to establish the values of key parameters for the
13:30
cooling systems this means there must be thermometers for temperature readings as
13:34
well as pressure gauges there also needs to be suitable alarms for temperature
13:39
pressure flow and level some of these will be linked to automatic slow down
13:45
and shutdown of the engine as an absolute minimum there should be
13:49
thermometers at the inlet and outlet from the engine and a pressure
13:53
at the pump discharge in practice as you will be able to see from the systems on
13:58
board your vessel there is usually more instrumentation than this fitted which
14:02
allows better monitoring and fault diagnosis of the system in order to
14:07
monitor the performance of a cooling system effectively it is not really
14:11
sufficient to have only the inlet and outlet temperatures and pressure of the
14:15
system you will also need to have detailed information as to the
14:19
efficiency of the heat exchangers with suitable instrumentation this is easily
14:24
achieved during operation the effectiveness of a heat exchanger will
14:29
be adversely affected by fouling either scale buildup or blockage by measuring
14:34
the temperature difference across the primary and secondary coolant sides of
14:38
the heat exchanger it is possible to pinpoint where fouling has occurred
14:42
imagine a scale buildup on the inside of the tubes of the cooler in a jacket
14:47
cooling water system there will be very little restriction to flow and pressure
14:52
drops across the cooler will be almost normal
14:55
however the scale will act as an insulator blocking the heat transfer
14:59
very little heat would be taken from the primary coolant the jacket water and
15:04
heat transfer to the secondary coolant the sea water will be reduced if you
15:09
check the cooler inlets and outlet temperatures of the two fluids you would
15:13
find the jacket water outlet temperature was higher than normal with a reduced
15:17
differential to the inlet and the sea water outlet temperature was lower than
15:22
normal again with a reduced differential to the inlet this would give a good
15:27
indication that the cooler had a scale buildup and required cleaning blockage
15:31
of the sea water site without scale build-up would reduce the flow of
15:35
seawater causing an increased sea water and jacket water outlet temperature when
15:41
a heat exchanger is partly blocked then the fluid flow is reduced and this will
15:45
affect the system temperatures as well as the pressures considering a jacket
15:49
water cooler with seawater as the coolant the sea water side is the most
15:54
likely to get blocked due to shells and other marine debris if a partial
15:59
blockage occurs it can be indicated in two ways the fluid outlet temperatures
16:04
will both be higher than normal and the outlet pressure of the seawater
16:07
will be reduced it may also be seen that the seawater inlet pressure is slightly
16:13
increased although this may not be noticeable in a seawater system serving
16:17
other coolers and services rather than comparing the inlet and outlet pressures
16:22
systems are often fitted with u-tube manometers which measure the pressure
16:27
drop across the cooler directly you will probably have this arrangement on board
16:32
your vessel for the diesel engine charged air coolers it is also commonly
16:36
used for pressure drops across filters on various systems before we can move on
16:41
to look at temperature control of a cooling system we need to consider a
16:45
basic control loop the basic components are shown in the diagram the transmitter
16:51
and positioner current red are not required for all systems control valves
16:57
and the different actuators used to power them are considered in detail in
17:01
the following pages you can click on the buttons to learn a bit more about the
17:06
function of each of the other elements although we cannot go into great detail
17:11
in discussing controllers in this module you should at least have an
17:14
understanding of what a controller is and what it does not every control
17:19
circuit requires a controller simple on-off control can be achieved directly
17:24
by using a switching device such as a thermostat as the sensor for more
17:29
complex control requirements then a controller is used the signal from the
17:34
sensor the measured value is sent to the controller where it is compared with the
17:38
setpoint the desired value the controller computes the difference
17:43
between the two signals and generates an output signal the output signal is used
17:48
to power the actuator connected to the control valve there is usually a
17:52
facility of the controller to changeover from automatic to manual control the
17:57
output signal from the controller is usually proportional to the difference
18:01
between the measured and desired values and so the controller is referred to as
18:05
proportional action control many of the controller is used in onboard systems
18:11
are more complex and use not only proportional action but also integral
18:16
derivative action again this is outside the scope of this module valve
18:22
positioners are widely used in marine control applications usually operating
18:27
with higher air pressures and increased air flow compared to the controller
18:31
there are many reasons for air valve position that might be fitted some of
18:35
the common ones are when accurate valve positioning is required to speed up the
18:40
valve response to act as an amplifier for the controller output signal when
18:45
there is a lot of friction in the valve and where varying differential pressures
18:49
within the fluid would cause the valve plug position to vary positioners can
18:54
also be used with a suitable electropneumatic converter to operate a
18:58
pneumatically actuated control valve in response to a direct signal from an
19:03
electrical controller or sensor the terms sensor and transducer can often be
19:10
used to refer to the same device a transducer is a device that measures one
19:14
physical characteristic and converts it to another an example of this is a
19:19
resistance thermometer as the temperature varies then there is a
19:23
corresponding variation in the resistance this change in resistance can
19:27
be used to generate a change in voltage which can be transmitted to the
19:30
controller in pneumatic control systems the term transmitter is often used for a
19:36
transducer the resistance thermometer is also a sensor since it is sensing the
19:41
temperature of a process fluid in our case cooling water temperature for
19:45
cooling water systems the main sensors used are shown in the list the last
19:50
three of these devices listed rely on a change in resistance with temperature to
19:55
vary a voltage output to the controller the most commonly used sensing device
20:00
for diesel engine cooling systems is the resistance thermometer in many
20:05
situations the output signal from the sensor is too small and needs to be
20:10
boosted this may also be the case where the sensor is a long way from the
20:14
controller to overcome this a transmitter can be used which can both
20:20
convert the signal and boost it before sending it to the controller
20:24
transmitters can be either pneumatic or electric types or converter
20:29
which change a pneumatic signal to an electrical signal or an electrical
20:34
signal to a pneumatic one the most common types of valves used for cooling
20:39
water system temperature control of a 3-way wex element valve hue matically
20:44
controlled three-way valve and occasionally electrically controlled
20:48
three-way valve the balance may have rotary valve plugs and ports or may have
20:54
contoured valve plugs and double seats which can improve control over a wide
20:59
range of operating conditions the choice of valve is really dependent on the
21:03
general control system installed for a particular machinery plant or there some
21:08
valves particularly wax element diverter valves are supplied as standard with
21:12
some engine types you can learn a bit more about each of these valve types by
21:17
clicking on the action buttons below wax element valves are one of the simplest
21:22
forms of temperature control valve and can be used as either mixing valves or
21:26
diverter valves they are often self-contained units with the wax
21:31
element acting as both the sensor and actuator for the valve
21:34
they are normally fitted into the primary coolant system to give direct
21:39
temperature sensing and control the valves are usually three way valves
21:44
having either two inlets and a single outlet when used as mixing
21:48
valves or one Inlet and two outlets when used as diverter valves in cooling water
21:55
systems the valves are normally used as diverter valves to give bypass of the
21:59
heat exchanger as the water temperature increases the wax which is normally
22:05
contained in a bellows unit expands and drives a push rod which moves the valve
22:09
plug to gradually close off the bypass port and open the flow through port this
22:15
arrangement ensures that the total flow bypass and through flow combined is
22:20
maintained for any valve position pneumatically actuated temperature
22:25
control valves are often three-way valves operated by a control air signal
22:29
acting on a diaphragm connected to the valve spindle this type is popular
22:35
because of its proven reliability and simplicity the arrangement may include a
22:40
valve positioner to give better response greater effort is required to move the
22:44
valve the valve can be fitted in the primary coolant system and arranged with
22:49
two Inlet connections one connected to the bypass line for the heat exchanger
22:53
and the other to the outlet from the heat exchanger and a single outlet
22:57
connection the inlet to the engine with a temperature sensor fitted to the
23:02
outlet line from the engine the outlet temperature can be controlled the valve
23:07
will usually backseat due to spring force when the signal pressure is at a
23:11
minimum this will normally be the through flow position which is
23:15
considered the failsafe position when the valve is used to control temperature
23:20
by varying the bypass flow of the heat exchanger you will almost certainly have
23:24
valves of this type fitted to some of the systems on your current vessel see
23:29
if they are arranged in the way described above the next time you are in
23:32
the engine room an electrically operated temperature control valve can be
23:36
arranged in exactly the same way as a pneumatic type but the actuator will be
23:41
an electrical device such as a linear motor or solenoid due to the relatively
23:45
high cost compared to pneumatic types electrical control valves are not
23:50
commonly used in cooling water systems as we have just seen a basic control
23:55
circuit consists of a sensor a controller and a control device which is
24:00
usually a valve complete with actuator the system may also include a positioner
24:05
and a transmitter normally the controlled parameter for a diesel engine
24:09
cooling system is the engine outlet temperature the desired value for the
24:14
temperature is used as the setpoint for the controller and the value measured by
24:18
the sensor is compared against this any difference between these two values
24:22
generates a correcting signal that is applied to the value actuator to alter
24:27
the valve setting this alteration in position will cause either an increase
24:32
or decrease in the amount of flow bypassing the heat exchanger in most
24:37
systems the temperature control valve is arranged so that part of the primary
24:41
coolant bypasses the heat exchanger if the measured temperature is lower than
24:45
the desired temperature some of the diesel engine cooling systems will have
24:49
more complex control circuits to help to improve the control and response over a
24:54
wide and low drain these will include splits range and
24:58
cascade control you can learn the basic principles of these two forms of control
25:03
by clicking on the action buttons where a system requires control of heating as
25:09
well as cooling then instead of having two separate control circuits a single
25:13
combined circuit can be arranged to control two valves this is done by
25:18
splitting the controller output signal range into two sections the example
25:22
given is for a simple split range control circuit for controlling the
25:26
temperature of the fuel valve cooling water system cascade control is a form
25:31
of control which uses two controllers a master and a slave with the output from
25:36
the master controller being used to onto the set point of the slave controller
25:40
each controller will measure a different process variable for example jacket
25:46
water temperature and sea water flow rate with this arrangement faster
25:50
response can be achieved over a wide load range for applications where
25:55
heating and cooling are required the cascade system can be adapted so that
25:59
the slave controller operates as a split range controller in order to provide
26:04
protection to the diesel engine against damaged due to operating outside of the
26:08
recommended limits a number of parameters are normally monitored
26:11
continuously many of these are associated with the engine coolant water
26:15
systems for those parameters which are considered essential for safe operations
26:20
safety devices which give automatic slowed down or shut down are provided in
26:25
addition to audible and visual alarms the set points are usually arranged to
26:30
give an alarm first and then a slowed down or shut down if the condition
26:35
deteriorates click on the action buttons to learn more about the common alarms
26:39
and safety devices associated with the different groups of parameters the main
26:44
temperature alarms associated with the various cooling systems for a diesel
26:48
engine are as shown in the list typically the alarm points are set 5 to
26:54
10 degrees Celsius above or below the normal temperature not every diesel
26:59
engine installation will have all of these alarms and you should check the
27:02
engine on your vessel to see the actual alarms fitted where operation of the
27:07
engine of temperatures above the white would lead to severe engine damage
27:11
then there will be further protection in the form of a slowdown or shutdown short
27:16
temperatures continue to rise typically these would be for jacket cooling water
27:21
high-temperature piston cooling water high temperature
27:24
and turbocharger cooling water outlet high temperature although it can be
27:30
considered as of secondary importance to temperature when dealing with cooling
27:34
water systems the system pressure is still an important parameter and
27:38
requires monitoring during operation there will only be low pressure alums
27:42
fitted for all of the diesel engine cooling water systems at the inlet to
27:47
the engine low pressure may be an indication of low
27:50
header tank level loss of coolant circulating pump failure system blockage
27:55
or failed piping any of which could lead to serious engine damage obviously
28:00
effective cooling of the diesel engine relies on constant flow of the coolant
28:04
at the required rate to remove excess heat any reduction or failure of flow
28:09
will result in local overheating and failure of the engine components diesel
28:14
engines with water-cooled Pistons normally have a flow indicator and alarm
28:18
at the return from each cylinder it is also common to her flow alarms and slow
28:23
down function arranged for the jacket water outlet from each unit one of the
28:28
simplest methods of sensing the flow for alarm purposes is to measure the
28:32
differential pressure across an orifice plate fitted in a section of pipe in the
28:36
system a reduction in the differential pressure is an indication of reduced
28:41
flow rate severe reduction in flow in the cooling system will normally result
28:46
in an automatic slowdown of the engine the main level alarm for diesel engine
28:51
cooling water systems is a low level alarm on the jacket water header tank
28:55
this gives protection in the event of leakage from the system either internal
29:00
or external to the engine there may also be a high level alarm fitted to the tank
29:05
to protect against overfilling the high level alarm can also give protection if
29:10
due to a cracked liner or cylinder cover combustion gas enters the system and
29:15
causes foaming of the water in the header tank there may also be high and
29:20
low level alarms fitted to the reservoir for any other cooling water systems to
29:24
give protection due to either cross leakage from secondary coolant or loss
29:29
of water due to leakage when testing any of the alarms or safety device functions
29:34
care must always be taken to ensure there is no danger of injury to
29:38
personnel or machinery damaged a suitable risk assessment should always
29:43
be made permit to work obtained and relevant personnel informed before any
29:48
testing is carried out the methods used should give a realistic simulation of
29:52
the actual event so that the function is properly tested rather than just
29:56
checking the switch action the following preferred methods for testing alarms
30:00
slowdowns and shutdowns should be used taking into account any specific
30:05
instructions from the manufacturer temperature place the temperature sensor
30:10
into a test tank provided with a heating element and thermometer the sensor
30:15
should be left connected to its circuit so that as the alarm or safety device
30:19
set point is reached an actual alarm slowdown or shutdown occurs pressure
30:25
shut off the pressure line to the sensor again with the circuit intact and bleed
30:30
the pressure until the setpoint is reached and the alarm slow down or shut
30:34
down occurs flow the signal should be gradually shut off until the alarm slow
30:41
down or shut down occurs the actual method depending on the type of sensor
30:45
level normally this will be a float alarm with either a separate float
30:50
chamber or with the float placed directly in the tank the preferred test
30:55
method is to isolate and drain the float chamber or push down the float until the
31:00
alarm slow down or shut down occurs in this chapter we have looked at the
31:05
various components that make up the diesel engine cooling water systems that
31:09
can be found on board you should now be aware of the different systems that are
31:13
required and also the common types of component within the systems and the
31:17
function of each of them we have also considered the various temperature
31:21
control methods and the alarm and safety devices that may be fitted to the
31:25
systems you should now be aware of the types used as well as the methods for
31:30
checking the alarms slowdowns and shutdowns associated with marine diesel
31:34
engine cooling systems with this knowledge you
31:37
should now be in a position to better understand the systems and Arrangements
31:41
on the vessels that you sail on you should use the knowledge along with the
31:45
operating manuals for the machinery on board your current vessel to make sure
31:49
that you understand the plant and can operate it safely in the next chapter we
31:53
will look at central cooling systems which are a common way to reduce the
31:57
size and complexity of the sea water system and minimize the amount of sea
32:01
water pipe work onboard the main benefit of this type of system as you will
32:06
appreciate should be reduced maintenance requirements for the cooling systems
