After completing this chapter the learner will understand the reasons for
00:04
introduction of central cooling systems know the operating principles of a
00:08
central cooling system know the general layout of a central cooling system
00:33
the amount of maintenance required for any cooling water system depends mainly
00:38
on the materials used for the pipe work consistent components and also on the
00:42
quality of the water and water treatment used in the system when using seawater
00:47
for temperatures over 50 degrees Celsius the level of corrosion and scale
00:51
formation becomes unacceptable the corrosion problem can to some extent be
00:57
avoided by material selection although the cost increases when using special
01:01
alloys some of the materials copper based alloys were mentioned in an
01:06
earlier chapter material selection does not really help with scale formation and
01:11
the only way to reduce this is to use better quality water in the systems this
01:16
is the main reason for the development of central cooling systems in which much
01:20
of the traditional sea water system is replaced by freshwater circuits this is
01:25
now the preferred option and it is likely that such a system is employed on
01:29
your present vessel you should check this out the next time you are in the
01:32
engine room the basic central cooling system has two interconnected freshwater
01:38
circuits one a high temperature circuit and the other a low temperature circuit
01:43
and a simple seawater circuit the freshwater circuits are normally
01:48
referred to as the HT and lt circuits to denote high and low temperature
01:53
respectively the HT circuit serves the diesel engine jacket cooling water
01:58
systems for the main and auxiliary engines it can also be used for heating
02:02
the freshwater generator typically the system operates to give an
02:06
outlet temperature from the engine of between 75 and 85 degrees Celsius the HT
02:13
circuit usually consists of two circulating pumps which circulate the
02:17
water through the main engine and auxilary engine jackets a 3-way
02:22
temperature control valve is provided which connects to the LT system
02:26
provision is also made to pass the HT water through the fresh water generator
02:31
heat exchanger when required with a suitable bypass facility when it is
02:36
offline the header tank and deaerator complete the system suitable valves for
02:41
isolating the engines and pumps are provided for maintenance purposes
02:46
while cooling requirements other than the main and auxiliary engine jackets
02:50
are met by the LT circuit this includes cooling for the main and auxiliary
02:54
engine lubricating oil and charge air other machinery served by the LT system
03:00
includes air compressors and refrigeration and air conditioning
03:04
compressors and condensers typically the LT system operates with a temperature of
03:09
about 37 degrees Celsius the system usually comprises two circulating pumps
03:14
and a number of heat exchangers the heat exchangers include those for cooling
03:19
lubricating oil and air for the diesel engines the air compresses and
03:23
refrigerating and air conditioning equipment as well as 2 C water-cooled
03:27
central coolers the three-way temperature control valve used in bypass
03:32
diverter mode controls the freshwater flow through the central coolers the LT
03:37
system is connected to the HT system via the 3-way mixing valve and a return
03:43
connection temperature control of the HT system is achieved by a 3-way valve used
03:49
as a mixing valve the sensor for controlling this valve is usually
03:53
positioned at the main engine jacket water outlet or the return line to the
03:57
circulating pumps constant engine outlet temperature is achieved by mixing water
04:03
from the LT circuit into the HT circuit via this 3-way valve as the HT water
04:09
temperature rises at the engine outlet due to increased engine power the sensor
04:14
detects the rise and sends a signal to the controller here it is compared to
04:19
the setpoint and a corrective signal is sent to the control valve which moves to
04:24
allow some of the LT water to mix with the HT water so reducing the temperature
04:28
there may be additional individual temperature control for the auxiliary
04:33
engines using thermostatically-controlled vowels
04:36
temperature control of the LT circuit is achieved by a 3-way valve used to
04:42
control the flow through the central coolers in a bypass arrangement the
04:46
sensor for the valve is positioned downstream from the point at which the
04:50
return from the central coolers re-enters the LT circuit as the
04:55
temperature of the system starts to rise due to increased thermal load
04:59
the sensor detects the rise and sends a signal to the controller here it is
05:04
compared to the setpoint and a corrective signal is sent to the control
05:07
valve which moves to allow some of the LT water to pass to the coolers so
05:12
reducing the temperature any further increase in thermal load on the system
05:16
will cause the valve to divert more flow to the coolers in some systems there are
05:22
additional 3-way valves to control temperatures of the individual services
05:26
by bypassing the primary fluids at the relevant heat exchangers minimum
05:31
temperature for the LT circuit may be achieved by using split range control to
05:36
control a heating unit in the system the sea-water circuit for a central cooling
05:40
system is very simple it usually consists of two seawater suction
05:45
strainers two or more circulating pumps and two heat exchangers for central
05:50
coolers these heat exchangers are usually of the plate type the material
05:55
used for the pipe work is generally high-quality complet based alloy
05:58
although some systems use stainless steel these materials produce
06:03
maintenance requirements as they are resistant to corrosion and as there is
06:08
so little pipe work in the system the cost is moderate the plates for the
06:12
heat exchanger are also made from high-quality material which is resistant
06:16
to corrosion stainless steel or titanium is often chosen since the high-strength
06:22
allows very thin plates to be used which improves heat transfer the central
06:27
cooling system can be adapted to provide cooling or heating for most of the
06:31
machinery on board the LT system can be used to provide the secondary fluid for
06:36
many of the cooling requirements such as air compressor heat exchanges and oil
06:40
coolers the HT system can be used as a source of heating we have already seen
06:46
that it can be used as the heat source for the freshwater generator it can also
06:51
be used to heat domestic water and a preheat machinery such as the main and
06:56
auxiliary diesel engines the seawater circuit can be used to provide pre
07:00
heated feed for the freshwater generator and also the cooling requirements for
07:05
any systems requiring direct seawater cooling to achieve lower temperatures
07:10
than can be achieved by the LT by doing this the number of subsystems
07:15
can be reduced than the overall plant simplified in this section we have
07:20
looked at the arrangement of a central cooling system you should now understand
07:24
the reasons for having such a system and be aware of the subsystems that make up
07:29
the main system you should also have an understanding of how the system
07:32
temperatures are controlled in the next chapter we will look at the maintenance
07:36
requirements of cooling water systems and in particular how we can treat the
07:42
systems to minimize this requirement
