After completing this chapter the learner will be familiar with the
00:03
configuration of a typical basic diesel engine cooling water system be familiar
00:08
with the configuration of the other cooling systems for a diesel engine
00:32
as we have already seen from the previous chapter we have to cool the
00:37
components and systems of a diesel engine if we wish to operate
00:40
continuously for long periods we can achieve this by circulating a primary
00:45
coolant which will take the heat from the engine components and then
00:49
circulating the primary and a secondary coolant through a heat exchanger to
00:53
remove the heat from the primary coolant having completed chapter 1 you should
00:58
now be aware of which coolants are suitable for the various cooling
01:01
requirements in this chapter we will look at the different cooling systems
01:05
that you are likely to be dealing with when you are operating large diesel
01:09
engines a diesel engine jacket water cooling system must be able to take away
01:15
the heat transferred into the cylinder components during the combustion process
01:20
to achieve this it will circulate a suitable coolant usually fresh water
01:24
through the cooling spaces provided these cooling spaces will usually be
01:29
around the cylinder liner and inside the cylinder cover the jacket water system
01:35
may also serve the exhaust valve cages and turbocharger casing for those
01:40
designs that require cooling the sketch shows a basic jacket water system using
01:45
fresh water as the primary coolant and sea water as the secondary coolant the
01:51
fresh water will normally enter at the lower part of the liner and exit from
01:54
the cylinder cover don't worry at this stage if you are not familiar with the
01:58
details and purpose of all of the components as we will look at these
02:02
individually in a later chapter obviously not every diesel engine jacket
02:08
cooling water system is operated with exactly the same parameter values that
02:13
are certain to be differences between systems due to different designs and
02:16
choice of materials for the various engine components also sea water
02:21
temperatures will vary due to the geographical area that the ship is
02:25
operating in the value is given in the table are typical for a large two-stroke
02:30
diesel engine you may find that the temperature of the jacket water may be
02:34
15 degrees Celsius or more higher for some small high-powered diesel engines
02:39
you should make yourself familiar with the actual values of the parameters for
02:44
all of the cooling systems for diesel engines on the ships you are
02:47
sailing with as part of your familiarization with the engine plant
02:51
although the primary purpose of a jacket water system is to cool the diesel
02:55
engine it can also serve as secondary function by providing a preheating
03:00
facility for the engine this is particularly necessary when preparing
03:04
the engine for a first start in cold climates in order to minimize thermal
03:09
stresses the other cooling systems included in this module will have a pre
03:14
heat facility the diesel engine requires the heat of compression of the air in
03:18
the cylinder to provide the ignition source for the fuel to help achieve this
03:23
the engine cylinder can be warmed using a jacket water preheating system the
03:28
heating for the jacket cooling water can be provided by a sub circuit of the main
03:32
system using electrical heating elements or steam heating coils some systems use
03:37
the heat from the auxiliary engine cooling system to preheat the main
03:41
system by using suitable crossover arrangements what arrangements do you
03:46
have on your ship at present if you are unsure you should check it out next time
03:51
you are in the engine room different jacket water cooling systems
03:55
will have different layouts and valve arrangements the principles of operation
04:00
however will be the same before starting the system the header
04:04
tank level should be checked and adjusted as necessary and all of the
04:08
valves should be correctly set for preheating once the pumps are started
04:13
the valves should be adjusted to regulate the flow so as to ensure
04:17
correct temperatures throughout the system when the temperature of the
04:21
system has reached the required level and all other required conditions met
04:25
the engine can be started and the preheating shutoff temperatures and flow
04:30
are usually monitored at each cylinder the temperature control in modern
04:34
systems is usually an automatic function and in the system shown it is controlled
04:39
by a 3-way valve we will look at what about a control in more detail later in
04:44
the module
04:47
you should familiarize yourself with the system on the ship that you were on
04:51
including the means used to manually regulate the temperature in the event of
04:55
control function failure this applies to all of the systems for the equipment
05:00
that you may be involved with as well as the cylinder cover and
05:05
cylinder liner the Pistons also heat up due to the combustion process they also
05:11
received some heat due to friction between piston rings and liner and
05:15
piston skirt and liner even though when operating correctly these surfaces are
05:20
separated by an oil film frictional heat is still generated and transferred
05:24
between components in large slow speed engines the Pistons are usually cooled
05:29
by a separate system to the jacket water the coolant mainly used for this is oil
05:34
from the main lubricating oil system though some older systems used fresh
05:39
water the preference for oil is due to the risk of coolant leakage into the
05:44
crankcase as was stated earlier trunk piston engines use lubricating oil
05:48
either circulated through the piston crown or splashed up in the crankcase as
05:53
a piston coolant with water as the coolant a so-called cocktail shaker
05:57
effect is often used to optimize the cooling effect on the piston the cooling
06:03
chambers are designed to be half full and the reciprocating motion of the
06:06
piston causes the water to be thrown onto the underside of the piston crown
06:11
as if it was a cocktail shaker most of the large two-stroke engines
06:16
that you will sail with will have oil cooled Pistons certainly the majority of
06:21
recently built engines will use oil as the coolant however there are still many
06:26
engines in service which were designed for water cooling of the Pistons the
06:30
values given in the table are typical for a large two-stroke diesel engine one
06:36
of the main large two-stroke engine manufacturers used the piston cooling
06:40
system for cooling the turbocharger rather than the jacket water system
06:44
since it was felt that the temperatures and the pressures for the system were
06:48
better suited again make yourself familiar with the actual values of the
06:52
parameters for the systems on the ship's you were sailing with as part of your
06:55
familiarization with the engine plant before starting the system the drain
07:01
tank level should be checked and adjusted as necessary the tank should
07:05
also be checked for any oil contamination typically the cooling
07:09
water is supplied to and returned from the Pistons fly a telescopic Clips the
07:15
telescopic pipes are arranged so that the sealing glands are outside of the
07:19
crankcase to minimize the risk of contaminating the lubricating oil system
07:23
it is necessary to monitor these sealing glands for leakage once the tank is at
07:28
normal level and the valves have been correctly set the pump can be started
07:33
continuous flow of cooling water through each piston is essential for continued
07:38
operation and sight glasses are normally fitted in the return pipes so that flow
07:42
can be monitored the temperature is usually monitored at each cylinder and
07:46
the cooler bypass is used to adjust it this basic system shows the temperature
07:52
being manually controlled click on the button to see the operation of the
07:56
system
08:39
the location in the cylinder head and the exposure of the injector nozzle to
08:44
the combustion chamber mean that excess heat has to be removed to avoid seizure
08:49
of the needle valve and overheating of the fuel within the fuel injection valve
08:53
any failure of the system such as blockage or scale deposits would cause
08:58
the fuel injection valves to overheat and seize will lead to carbon deposits
09:02
inside the valves due to overheating of the fuel having an additional system
09:07
means increased cost and maintenance other common problems associated with
09:12
these systems include contamination of the coolant with fuel due to leakages
09:16
within the fuel injection valves and corrosion of valve bodies to avoid the
09:21
problems associated with fuel valve cooling systems engine manufacturers
09:26
have developed their engine designs to avoid the need for such systems if you
09:30
were on ships with older engines you may still come across fuel valve cooling
09:34
systems the type of fuel that the engine operates on will influence the cooling
09:39
arrangements for the fuel injection valves click on the action buttons to
09:43
learn more about this for some engines operating on distillate fuel the risk of
09:48
overheating a fuel injection valves due to transfer of residual heat when the
09:52
engine was first stopped meant that a separate cooling system was necessary
09:57
during normal load operation the flow of the relatively cold fuel was sufficient
10:02
to maintain acceptable temperatures some systems combine the cooling for fuel
10:07
injection valves and exhaust valve cages freshwater is used as the coolant oil or
10:13
freshwater could be used for fuel valve cooling where these systems are separate
10:17
by fitting an additional heat exchanger the system could also be used to
10:22
maintain valve temperatures when operating at low load to avoid possible
10:26
cold corrosion problems this heating facility would also be used to preheat
10:31
the fuel in the injection valves to improve starting of a cold engine for
10:36
engines using heavy fuel oil the fuel injection valves require positive
10:40
cooling since the hot fuel means that the valves are at a higher temperature
10:45
either a separate cooling system or some means to ensure continuous flow of the
10:50
fuel through the injector bodies to remove excess heat is
10:53
necessary wear a separate cooling system is fitted oil or fresh water can be used
10:59
as the coolant with this type of system it is normal to change from heavy to
11:04
distillate fuel allowing plenty of time to clear the lines of all of the heavy
11:08
fuel before the engine was stopped the heating facility is usually included to
11:13
maintain temperatures at low load and for pre-start
11:16
current practice is to have automatic recirculation of the fuel through the
11:21
valves when the engine has stopped this allows acceptable temperatures to be
11:25
maintained even with want heavy fuel oils you will possibly have some
11:30
experience of this type of arrangement if you've worked with heavy fuel burning
11:34
engines built in the last 20 years most diesel engines that you will sail with
11:38
will be designed to operate without separate cooling of the fuel injection
11:42
valves instead they will use either recirculation of the fuel or cylinder
11:48
cover design to achieve the required cooling however there are still many
11:52
engines in service which were designed with separate valve cooling systems the
11:57
values given in the table are typical for a large two-stroke diesel engine and
12:01
would be similar for many four-stroke engines again make yourself familiar
12:05
with the actual values of the parameters for the systems on the ships you were
12:10
sailing with as part of your familiarization with the engine plant
12:13
with a system filled and the tank level correct the pump can be started once the
12:18
discharge and system valves are set to circulate the cooling water prior to
12:23
starting the engine the fuel valve coolant is heated by passing it through
12:27
the pre heater this heats up the injectors and the fuel contained in them
12:32
close to normal operating temperatures which makes starting easier once the
12:36
cooling system temperature exceeds normal levels the pre heater is shut off
12:40
and the temperature can be controlled by adjusting the cooler bypass when
12:46
operating continuously on low load it may be necessary to maintain
12:49
temperatures by using the pre heater again the temperature control can be
12:54
either manual or automatic because of the high risk of fuel contamination of
12:59
the cooling water in this type of system the system tank should be checked
13:03
regularly during operation
13:43
diesel engines that are designed to operate without any pressure charging of
13:48
the combustion air are referred to as naturally aspirated this type of design
13:53
is usually restricted to engines for emergency duties it is likely that you
13:58
will have some engines of this type on board your vessel now for example the
14:02
lifeboat engines or emergency fire pump engine the vast majority of diesel
14:07
engines that you sail with will be pressure charged usually using an
14:11
exhaust gas driven turbocharger the purpose of pressure charging a diesel
14:15
engine is to increase the mass of air in the cylinder and so allow greater power
14:20
to be developed by burning a greater quantity of fuel than would be possible
14:23
with a naturally aspirated engine the air delivered to the engine by a
14:27
turbocharger or other compressor device will be hot due to the compression
14:32
process it is not uncommon for the air temperature to exceed 100 degrees
14:37
Celsius at the exit from the turbocharger compressor at this
14:41
temperature the air density is low and the mass for a given volume quite small
14:46
to increase the effective mass of air in the cylinder it is necessary to cool the
14:51
air to increase the density before it enters the engine the purpose of the
14:56
charge air cooler or intercooler as it is referred to on some engines is to
15:01
reduce the air temperature to the required level typically the air
15:05
temperature at inlet to the engine will be in the range of 35 degrees Celsius to
15:09
50 degrees Celsius in order to achieve the relatively low air temperatures
15:15
required at the engine Inlet the coolant temperature has to be lower than the
15:19
final air temperature this means that the jacket cooling water cannot be used
15:24
and many engines therefore use seawater as the primary coolant for charge air
15:28
cooling when sea water is used as the primary coolant a direct feed from the
15:33
main seawater system is supplied to the charge air cooler either a three-way
15:38
valve or a bypass valve in parallel with the charge air cooler is used to
15:42
regulate the air temperature you will see later in the module that where a
15:46
central cooling system is employed it is possible to use the fresh water from the
15:50
low temperature circuit to cool the charged air as indicated in an earlier
15:55
section some medium and high speed engines have separate cooling water
15:58
systems for the exhaust valve cages this may be combined with the fuel valve
16:03
cooling water system for large two-stroke engines cooling of the
16:08
exhaust valve cages is usually an extension of the main jacket cooling
16:12
water system for the majority of modern engines exhaust valve cage cooling is
16:16
achieved using the main jacket water system by either circulating the jacket
16:21
water through balls in the cage or by the position of the cooling spaces in
16:25
the cylinder cover there are also some engine designs which
16:28
have water cooling for the exhaust manifold although this is not very
16:32
common we have seen that it is preferable to use fresh water as the
16:35
primary coolant for the engine jacket cooling system we have also seen that
16:40
sea water can be used as the secondary coolant for the jacket water and other
16:44
cooling systems we will also see later in the module our sea water usage can be
16:49
kept to a minimum by employing a central cooling system in practice where sea
16:54
water is used as the secondary coolant it is normal to arrange the seawater to
16:58
flow through the heat exchangers of the various engine systems in series with
17:02
this arrangement the sea water flows through the heat exchanger for the
17:06
system with the lowest required temperature before passing to the next
17:10
one it is not normally possible to arrange the charged air cooling in this
17:14
way and this is usually fed directly from the sea water main each heat
17:18
exchanger is fitted with a bypass valve to control individual system
17:22
temperatures while still ensuring the required sea water flow for cooling the
17:26
other systems sometimes provision is made to feed the jacket water system
17:31
from the sea water system in the event of loss of fresh water this facility
17:36
should be regarded as a short-term emergency means of operation and when
17:40
called this way the engine would be operated at reduced load to reduce the
17:46
risk of accidental admission of sea water to the system the cross
17:49
connections are normally provided with locked nerves or blanking plates
17:53
obviously the sea water temperature will vary depending on where in the world the
17:58
ship is operating the temperature range for sea water is from sub-zero up to
18:03
about 38 degrees Celsius the majority of engines are designed to operate
18:08
with a minimum seawater temperature of about 10 degrees Celsius to achieve this
18:13
the system will usually be fitted with a recirculation facility with part of the
18:17
water in the system being returned to the pump suction rather than being
18:21
discharged overboard the recirculation and therefore the minimum temperature
18:25
can be controlled with a three-way valve using either manual or automatic
18:30
adjustment seawater system pressure is usually in the range of 2 to 3 bar gauge
18:36
pressure with the actual value dictated by the vertical position of the coolers
18:40
relative to the pump outlet and the valve and piping arrangement after
18:45
opening ship side low suction and overboard valves suction strain Inlet
18:49
and outlet valves pump suction valve and the bypass and inlet valves on each
18:54
cooler one of the seawater pumps can be started with the discharge valve partly
18:59
open once the pump has run up then the discharge barrel can be fully opened
19:04
once the engine is started the temperatures of the individual systems
19:08
can be controlled by using the cooler outlet and bypass valves to give the
19:13
required sea water flow through each cooler in practice the outlet and bypass
19:18
functions are usually combined by using an automatic 3-way valve on the primary
19:23
fluid which avoids the need to manually balance the individual valves to
19:28
maintain correct flow in the sea water system we will look at automatic control
19:32
later in the module many smaller diesel engines are arranged with integral
19:37
services and systems including the cooling water systems some small diesel
19:42
engines may be sea water cooled for example live boat engines although fresh
19:47
water is always the preferred option with these arrangements the cooling
19:51
water pumps as well as other service pumps such as lubricating oil and fuel
19:55
oil are normally mounted on and driven by the engine in some cases small
20:00
electric driven pumps are provided for first start and standby requirements the
20:06
heat exchanges for the various services are also usually engine mounted on this
20:10
type of engine it is probable that the auxiliary engines on your ship have an
20:14
arrangement similar to this the heat which is carried away by the
20:19
jacket water as we have seen originates partly from the combustion of fuel in
20:23
the cylinder when the heat is transferred from the jacket water to
20:27
seawater then the heat is wasted it is just dumped into the sea if any of the
20:32
heat can be used for a productive purpose then the overall plant
20:35
efficiency can be improved one common means of achieving this is to use the
20:40
heat from the jacket water to heat the feed and the generating elements for a
20:44
freshwater generator this reduces the cost of freshwater production on board
20:49
as no additional fuel is required to provide the necessary heat energy using
20:54
the jacket water in this way also means that the freshwater generator is being
20:58
used as a cooler for the engine jacket water cooling system the full operating
21:02
details of the freshwater generator are outside of the scope of this module and
21:07
you should refer to CBT module zero 98 for more information on this piece of
21:13
equipment if you are not familiar with it in this chapter we have looked at all
21:17
of the cooling water systems which may be required to allow continuous
21:21
operation of a diesel engine the systems for any particular engine will be
21:26
determined by the actual design of that engine the systems we have considered
21:30
have all used sea water is the secondary coolant this probably seems logical to
21:35
you as there is plenty of it and it is normally relatively cold using seawater
21:40
however means that the systems are subject to scaling fouling and corrosion
21:45
which not only affect the efficiency of the system but also increases downtime
21:50
and maintenance costs minimizing the use of sea water as a secondary coolant also
21:56
minimizes these adverse effects we will see in a later chapter that separate
22:00
systems are no longer the preferred choice it is now common with modern
22:04
designs to use central cooling systems with freshwater as the primary and
22:09
secondary coolant for most cooling duties and only a simple seawater
22:13
circuit for final heat removal we will consider this in more detail in a later
22:18
chapter
