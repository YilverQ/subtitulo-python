The learning objectives of this chapter are to introduce the learner to the need
00:04
to cool a diesel engine that the learner will know which diesel engine components
00:08
and systems require cooling
00:32
diesel engines are machines designed to convert the chemical energy of fuel to
00:37
mechanical energy in order to produce power this power is then used to do work
00:43
the work may be done in turning a propeller to drive a ship or to drive an
00:47
electrical generator to provide electrical power the energy conversion
00:51
process involves combustion of the fuel within the engine cylinder during
00:56
combustion heat is released and pressure is generated forcing down the piston the
01:01
piston is connected to the crankshaft through the connecting rod the downward
01:07
movement of the piston causes the crankshaft and the driven unit it is
01:11
connected to two-term unfortunately not all of the chemical energy can be
01:15
converted into work and some of the released heat energy transfers to the
01:20
engine components and some is lost to exhaust and the other engine fluids heat
01:25
is also lost to the surroundings due to radiation the moving parts of the engine
01:29
also subject to frictional effects and the work done in overcoming this
01:34
friction transfers heat to these components for example bearings piston
01:39
rings and cams click on the button to see various stages
02:13
if the diesel engine was left uncooled then serious operational problems are
02:17
likely to occur the high operating temperatures would result in clearances
02:23
between components reducing due to thermal expansion leading to seizure
02:27
material properties of the various components deteriorating leading to
02:31
failure due to excessive mechanical than thermal stress damage to pump seals and
02:37
ceilings leading to leakage oxidation and reduced viscosity of the lubricating
02:42
oil resulting in metal to metal contact between components due to oil film
02:47
failure you should therefore realize that there is a need to cool a diesel
02:50
engine in order to avoid these failures if it is to operate continuously for
02:55
long periods some small diesel engines may be directly air-cooled with or
03:02
without forced air circulation you may have some small diesel engines onboard
03:07
your ship possibly lifeboat engines or emergency compressor engines which are
03:12
air-cooled you will recognize them by the presence
03:15
of extended fins around the cylinder block or by a cooling fan unit direct
03:19
air cooling is only suitable for the smallest low rated diesel engines for
03:24
the vast majority of marine diesel engines direct air cooling is
03:28
insufficient and other cooling mediums must be used such as water or oil these
03:34
are usually closed systems with the same coolant circulated continuously the
03:39
fluids normally used in a closed circuit can be considered as the primary coolant
03:43
with a secondary coolant being used to take heat from the primary to avoid it
03:48
overheating primary coolants are usually freshwater or lubricating oil and
03:52
secondary coolant may be fresh water or sea water or in some cases air click the
03:59
images to see the unlock before moving on you should click on the button for a
04:03
brief explanation of the role of lubricating oil as a coolant
04:42
the primary purpose of lubricating oil is to form an oil film between two
04:47
moving surfaces and so reduce friction in doing so the oil heats up partly due
04:53
to the friction of the oil molecules moving across each other under load and
04:57
partly due to heat transfer from hot engine components as the oil heats up
05:02
the viscosity and therefore the load carrying capacity will reduce and it can
05:07
no longer keep the moving surfaces apart this will lead to further heating and
05:12
deterioration of the oil it is therefore necessary to cool the lubricating oil to
05:17
maintain its performance and condition in small engines the hot oil transfers
05:22
heat to the atmosphere through finned coils or through the surface of the oil
05:26
pan in larger engines it is necessary to circulate the oil through external heat
05:38
exchangers where the heat is transferred to a secondary coolant this continuous
05:43
circulation and transfers to a secondary coolant means that the lubricating oil
05:48
is being used as the primary coolant for some engine components an ideal coolant
05:58
should be low most readily available non scale forming
06:02
and non corrosive it should also have a high specific heat capacity this is a
06:08
measure of the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a unit mass
06:11
of the substance by one Kelvin K the units for specific heat capacity are
06:18
usually given as kilo joules per kilogram Kelvin the higher the specific
06:22
heat capacity the more heat can be taken away from the materials which require
06:27
cooling it is also desirable for the coolant to have a low viscosity to
06:32
minimize flow resistance in the cooling system this makes water the first choice
06:37
for most cooling systems usually with the addition of additives such as
06:41
corrosion inhibitors when selecting a coolant it is also necessary to consider
06:46
the risk of contamination due to leakage so for example cooling a piston in a
06:52
diesel engine with water has a high risk of contaminating the lubricating oil
06:56
system in this case lubricating oil may be chosen to avoid this risk even though
07:02
water may be the better coolant click on each of the images to know more about
07:07
various coolants that are available in the marine environment although
07:19
is plentiful it has a relatively low specific heat capacity approximately 1.0
07:24
kilo joules per kilogram Kelvin the low density of air would require that large
07:30
volumes would need to be supplied to take away the heat from the various
07:33
diesel engine systems AirCam however be used as a coolant irrespective the
07:38
process temperature range air-cooled radiators are used on some smaller
07:42
engines with the air as the secondary coolant being forced through the
07:46
external fins of the radiator by a firm
08:09
the moderate specific heat capacity of mineral oil two point zero to two point
08:14
five kilo joules per kilogram Kelvin means that using oil as a coolant is
08:19
generally restricted to those applications where lubrication is also
08:23
required as stated earlier if current leakage would be a problem for example
08:29
water in the engine crankcase then cooling with oil may be the preferred
08:33
choice rather than using complex sealing arrangements oil has a wider useful
08:42
temperature range than water although excess temperatures can lead to
08:46
oxidation and carbon deposits synthetic or thermal oils can be used to extend
08:52
the temperature range at low pressure although thermal oil is normally used
08:56
for heating purposes rather than as a coolant
09:08
see water would be the first choice coolant for marine applications if it
09:12
was not for the associated scale problems it is cheap plentiful has good
09:18
specific heat capacity approximately 4.0 kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin and low
09:23
viscosity scale formation increases with operating temperature which limits the
09:28
useful temperature range and means that using direct sea water cooling for
09:32
modern engines is not really practical some cooling systems still have a
09:38
facility allowing emergency operation and sea water cooling but usually at
09:42
restricted loads in most cases the use of sea water as a coolant is limited to
09:48
secondary cooling applications where temperature requirements are lower and
09:52
scale formation can be minimized
10:00
freshwater meets all of the requirements for a coolant however it is not readily
10:05
available and has to be stored or produced on board the specific heat
10:10
capacity is approximately 4.2 kilo joules per kilogram Kelvin which gives a
10:16
very good cooling effect when produced on board by a freshwater generating
10:20
plant the water is almost pure therefore scale formation is not really a problem
10:25
however the slightly acidic water that is produced by such a plant has to be
10:30
chemically treated as we will see later to prevent corrosion fresh water is
10:35
preferred as the primary coolant for diesel engine jacket water systems and
10:39
as the secondary coolant for the other engine systems the temperature range is
10:43
limited by the relatively low boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius although
10:48
this can be increased by having a closed pressurized system
10:57
the table shows the comparison among the various coolants that are available in a
11:02
marine environment it is clear that there is a need to cool the diesel
11:10
engine we must now decide on which components and which ancillary systems
11:15
will have to be cooled the simple answer is any component or system that will not
11:19
function properly atomic temperature the items which will
11:23
be affected most are those which are directly exposed to the combustion
11:27
process or a subject of friction this will include all components forming the
11:32
combustion chamber and all moving components the engine fluids such as the
11:37
lubricating oil jacket water and charged air also need to be cooled we also need
11:43
to consider ancillary equipment such as the turbocharger which is subject to
11:47
heating due to friction and also the flow of exhaust gas through the turbine
11:52
side and the heating effect of compressing the air on the compressor
11:55
side click on the buttons to see which fluids and components require cooling
12:00
when the engine is operating it is worth noting at this point that too much
12:14
cooling can be detrimental to the operation of a diesel engine leading to
12:18
low thermal efficiency high running costs and engine damage obviously a
12:23
compromise is necessary before moving on you should click on the buttons to see
12:27
the components and ancillary equipment that need to be cooled as the engine
12:32
operates
12:41
the diesel engine components which are heated directly by the combustion
12:45
process are the piston and cylinder liner including any firing ring the
12:52
cylinder cover and fittings including exhaust valves inlet valves and fuel
12:57
injector and the piston rings in particular the top ring the diesel
13:03
engine components which heat up due to friction as they move are the piston
13:08
piston rings and cylinder liner the piston rods connecting rods and
13:13
associated bearings the cylinder cover valves and actuate in gear the
13:20
crankshaft and bearings including thrust arrangement the cam shaft and bearings
13:28
the chains chain wheels and bearings the internal gear drives and fuel injection
13:38
equipment click on the button to see the
13:49
you
14:00
as has already been stated the turbocharger will run at high
14:03
temperature due to the working conditions of the exhaust gas the
14:07
compression of the air and frictional heat from the bearings traditionally
14:11
large turbocharger casings were water-cooled usually using a sub circuit
14:16
of the main jacket water cooling system smaller units were awful air cooled many
14:22
of the latest generation of turbochargers have uncooled turbine
14:26
casings which reduces the total heat losses of the engine and increases
14:30
overall thermal efficiency with this design lubrication is usually taken from
14:36
the main engine lubricating oil system and the circulating oil carries away the
14:41
heat from the bearings exhaust side casings have to be well insulated for
14:46
the protection of personnel the vast majority of water-cooled engines use
14:57
freshwater as the primary coolant for the static components forming the
15:01
combustion chamber this is achieved by circulating the water through the space
15:06
between the cylinder liner and the cylinder block and the liner and the
15:10
cylinder jacket the system is therefore referred to as the jacket cooling water
15:15
system the water enters at the bottom of the cylinder liner and pulses up the
15:20
jacket and through the cylinder cover as it exits the engine this also provides
15:26
cooling for the valves and the operating gear many designs incorporate ball
15:31
cooling of these main components in which drilled passageways for the
15:35
coolant are positioned close to the surface of the component to be cold this
15:39
allows intense cooling while maintaining the strength of the component the air
15:44
for combustion is usually cooled by seawater after delivery from the
15:48
turbocharger before entering the cylinder although as we will see later
15:52
fresh water can be used the Pistons are usually cooled by a separate piston
15:57
cooling system which uses either fresh water or lubricating oil as the coolant
16:02
if freshwater cooling is used it is normally separate to the main jacket
16:07
water system the piston rings are cooled by conduction with heat transferring to
16:12
either the cooled cylinder wall or the Piston body the crankshaft and
16:19
associated bearings and four large slow speed engines the cross head arrangement
16:24
are cooled by the main lubricating oil system the camshaft and associated
16:29
bearings are cooled by lubricating oil circulation which in many designs is
16:34
separate to the engine's main lubricating system this minimizes the
16:39
risk of contamination of the main system by fuel oil leakage the frictional heat
16:43
generated by the piston motion in the liner is removed by the jacket water and
16:48
piston cooling systems in modern uncooled fuel injection systems the
16:53
component temperatures are normally maintained at acceptable levels by the
16:57
flow of fuel oil recirculation of fuel in the injectors may be used to assist
17:03
this in heavy fuel systems older fuel injection systems either relied on heat
17:10
transfer to the cylinder cover wet injector pockets in the cylinder cover
17:14
or forced circulation of coolant through balls in the injector body to maintain
17:19
acceptable temperatures the coolants used for this full circulation varied
17:24
and freshwater thermal oil and diesel oil have all been used by different
17:29
engine manufacturers in this particular module we will be
17:35
looking at engine cooling water systems but as you will see in many modern
17:40
designs this system is also used as the secondary coolant for the other engine
17:44
systems in older designs sea water was used as the secondary coolant for each
17:50
of the individual systems we shall have a detailed look at a basic jacket water
17:55
cooling system and also a central cooling system which is a common
17:59
solution used to minimize the use of sea water cooling and the high maintenance
18:03
needs of such a system
