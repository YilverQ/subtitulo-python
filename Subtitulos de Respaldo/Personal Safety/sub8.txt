encounters workplaces involving a wide

00:27
geographical isolation demanding
00:30
specialized skills awareness and a

planned approach all new personnel
00:38
joining a ship must undergo a safety
00:41
induction procedure conducted by a
00:44
responsible officer which must at bare
00:48
minimum cover the requirements as
00:51
stipulated by the SD CW code this should
00:57
include a clear explanation of the

making crew members aware that safety of

shipmates depends on the action of the

individual designating responsibilities

amongst crew members to identify areas
02:51
which pose potential safety hazards and
02:54
ensure that the necessary corrective
02:57
measures are taken by reducing emissions
