In this section we're going to look more closely at health and safety factors the
00:05
seaman should take a notice of in his daily work health control requirements
00:10
in the company local port state and flag state and various hazard sources that
00:16
may hardly affect the employees health
00:39
some companies practice a very strict drug abuse policy any employee may risk
00:46
unannounced testing refusal to participate in such testing would be
00:51
considered as a positive test result the company drug abuse policy is described
00:58
in the company quality manual vessel procedures in case of accidents where a
01:04
third country jurisdiction prevails local authorities like the US Coast
01:09
Guard and most of the oil majors may require testing to ensure that personnel
01:15
involved have not been under the influence of alcohol or drugs u.s. Coast
01:21
Guard requirements are to be found in the u.s. Coast Guard publication number
01:25
five point one point five rules and regulations of the flag state include
01:32
provisions requiring that all employees shall undergo certain health control
01:36
procedures prior to serving on board a vessel the extent of the control and the
01:42
specific requirements depend on the position in which the person shall serve
01:46
you should make yourselves familiar with the rules and regulations your vessels
01:51
flag state requires in the daily work on board you may be exposed to various
01:57
hazardous sources that may affect your health this can be caused by cargo
02:02
related substances which vary in the different cargos and trades and
02:07
substances that are present in the environment on board most ships and
02:11
which are related to routine operations and maintenance procedures such
02:16
hazardous sources are gases liquids noise
02:24
heating chemicals vibrations during any
02:31
operation it is very important that the personnel involved are familiar with the
02:36
precautions to be taken when handling hazardous sources
02:40
this requires know-how about actual source and its possible influence on
02:45
health let us look at a well known operation painting any kind of paint
02:52
contains thinners that may affect your health if inhaled Bunker oil may also
02:58
contain toxic vapors such hazardous situations can be avoided by obtaining
03:04
information about health hazards obtaining information about health
03:09
precautions personnel working with paint or chemicals used for cleaning and other
03:15
purposes should be aware of the dangers associated with inhaling the vapors from
03:19
such products and the effects of chemicals on the skin one should also
03:25
seek information about health hazards information about health hazards is
03:29
given in data sheets which according to the Siemens Act are always required to
03:34
be available on board
03:37
information about health precautions is available from various sources for
03:43
instance the International Maritime Dangerous Goods code supplement you can
03:47
also ask your work leader for guidance some types of work require special
03:53
written permits or procedures to follow before the crew member can start on the
03:57
job that is work such as entering enclosed spaces working a loft hot work
04:05
cold work most companies have special written procedures or checklists for
04:11
these kinds of jobs these checklists vary from ship type to ship type company
04:17
to company and from flag state to flag state so it is important that you make
04:23
yourselves familiar with your vessels procedures click on the text boxes for
04:28
more information an enclosed space is one with restricted access that is not
04:34
subject to continuous ventilation and in which the atmosphere may be hazardous
04:39
due to the presence of hydrocarbon gas toxic gases inert gas or oxygen
04:45
deficiency this definition includes cargo tanks ballast tanks fuel tanks
04:52
water tanks lubricating oil tanks sewage tanks coffer dams duct keels and similar
05:01
enclosed spaces it also includes inert gas scrubbers and water seals and any
05:07
other item of machinery or equipment that is not routinely ventilated and
05:12
entered such as boiler and main engine crankcases many of the fatalities in
05:17
enclosed spaces have resulted from entering the space without proper
05:21
supervision or adherence to agreed procedures the rapid rescue of personnel
05:27
who have collapsed in an enclosed space presents particular risk it is a human
05:33
reaction to go to the aid of a colleague from impulsive and ill-prepared rescue
05:38
attempts entry enclosed space permit is a document issued by a responsible
05:44
person permitting entry to a space or compartment during a specific time
05:49
interval working aloft is defined as any work
05:53
above normal reach and where personnel are faced with risk of falling more than
05:58
two meters typical areas are the superstructure funnel masts tanks engine
06:06
room and the ship's side using a stage bosun's chair Jacob's Ladder all lifting
06:12
up personnel with the safety harness in for example pump room or engine room
06:18
emergency escape falling when performing work aloft can cause serious accidents
06:24
if proper safety precautions are taken such work can be performed without
06:29
accidents hot work is any work involving welding or burning and other work
06:35
including certain drilling and grinding operations electrical work and the use
06:40
of non intrinsically safe electrical equipment which might produce an
06:45
incentive spark it covers all such work regardless of where it is carried out on
06:51
board a ship including open decks machinery rooms and the engine room hot
06:57
work outside the engine room workshop must be prohibited until the
07:02
requirements of national legislation and other applicable regulations have been
07:06
met safety consideration taken into account and hot work permit has been
07:11
issued experience shows that such work is among the most common fire producing
07:17
activities on board a vessel if proper safety precautions are taken such work
07:23
can be performed without accidents a hot work permit is a document issued by a
07:28
responsible person permitting specific hot work to be done during a specific
07:33
time interval in a defined area cold work is work which cannot create a
07:38
source of ignition that means that cold work relates to any work in a hazardous
07:44
or dangerous area which will not involve generation of temperature condition
07:48
likely to be of sufficient intensity to cause ignition of combustible gases
07:53
vapors or liquids within or adjacent to the area involved examples of such cold
08:01
work are blank d blanking disconnecting or connecting
08:07
pipe work removing and fitting of valves blanks spades or blinds work on pumps
08:15
