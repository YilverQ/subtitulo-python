00:23
welcome to the world of the bulk carrier
00:26
it's a safe world provided you follow
00:29
clear rules but a minority of people
00:32
ignore these rules sometimes and that is
00:35
when accidents happen
00:38
temptation number one is to go into
00:40
prohibited areas when a ship is loading
00:42
or unloading would you go
01:12
what happens when some of the cargo
01:14
spills under the deck and you're
01:16
underneath it or it's something like
01:19
this happens
01:21
a fall from this height would in most
01:24
cases be fatal
01:26
[Music]
01:28
when part of the deck has been roped off
01:31
it's to stop people entering and working
01:33
in prohibited areas and you should
01:35
always follow the rules on your ship
01:37
about the wearing of hard hats even when
01:40
you have the mission to be in a
01:41
restricted area accidents can still
01:44
happen through poor communication like
01:47
here if the loading operators don't know
01:49
you're in the area when they decide to
01:51
start work
01:53
[Music]
01:55
here's temptation number two a quick
01:58
cigarette break next to an access hatch
02:01
would you accept the invitation
02:24
if what are you smoking here for he's
02:28
right to be angry access hatches often
02:31
contain me thing if the cargo is coal or
02:33
chemical vapors an explosion or fire
02:36
could kill you and your shipmates
02:43
temptation number three involves
02:45
enclosed spaces these crew members have
02:48
followed correct procedures and obtained
02:50
an entry permit
03:07
but supposing you had a colleague like
03:10
this who entered an access hatch but
03:12
then slipped and fell if there's an
03:17
emergency it's easy to forget your
03:19
training and act on instinct and nothing
03:23
is more natural and to go to the help of
03:25
someone in trouble but in an uncleared
03:28
enclosed space without the right
03:30
breathing apparatus this is the most
03:32
dangerous thing you could possibly do on
03:34
both carriers there are additional risks
03:37
Cole can create pockets of explosive
03:40
methane or poisonous carbon monoxide
03:43
grain cargoes can drain the air of
03:45
oxygen chemical cargoes can create toxic
03:49
vapors the risk is that you will be
03:51
poisoned or suffocate from lack of
03:53
oxygen if you decide not to go down
03:56
you're very wise never give in to the
04:00
temptation to enter an enclosed space
04:02
without backup without first checking
04:04
the atmosphere while wearing the right
04:06
breathing equipment on most occasions
04:09
you will also need a permit to work
04:10
approved by an officer to confirm that
04:13
the space has been checked that you have
04:15
the right equipment
04:22
one of the strongest temptations on a
04:24
bulk carrier or any other kind of ship
04:26
is to leave little cleaning up jobs to
04:29
someone else who's going to clear this
04:31
up
04:37
if you ignore a spillage or you don't
04:40
bother to report it it becomes an
04:42
accident waiting to happen
04:56
how long does it take to clear away a -
04:58
village ten minutes 20 however long it
05:02
takes it's much quicker than recovering
05:04
from a broken or twisted ankle even a
05:07
minor injury could result in your being
05:09
taken off the ship the fifth temptation
05:13
is to work with a naked flame or with
05:15
welding equipment without first getting
05:17
authoritative from an officer who has
05:20
made sure that the equipment and the
05:21
location are safe and that you are
05:24
wearing suitable protective clothing
05:31
suppose you can see that a bit of extra
05:33
welding is needed would you be really
05:36
happy to do it without checking with the
05:37
chief mate first its usual to have a hot
05:42
work permit stating that the area is
05:44
suitable and the right precautions have
05:46
been taken what would you have done
05:48
would you have checked with the chief
05:50
mate first
05:53
the sixth temptation is to stop
05:56
concentrating when opening the cargo
05:58
hatches if it's a job you've done many
06:00
times before it's easy to get bored it's
06:04
worse if you're tired but this is a time
06:08
when it's important to take extra care
06:10
in particular you should make certain
06:12
that no one is in the way of the hatch
06:14
covers if there's a lot of noise they
06:17
may not know what you're doing
06:22
is he going to check that no one's in
06:25
the way would you do company rules call
06:29
from officer or our experienced person
06:31
to be supervising the operation
06:39
you may have done the job safely a
06:41
hundred times but it only takes one
06:44
careless mistake to ruin someone's life
06:46
and your own one simple check every time
06:52
is all you need to be sure that you're
06:54
working safely
07:04
I'm going to open up the hatch now so
07:07
you must do that later okay okay
07:08
come on uh quickly
07:19
the final temptation is to cut corners
07:22
on personal safety when working near
07:24
dusty cargoes like coal or grain it's
07:30
essential to wear a mask the
07:32
concentrations of dust in these cargoes
07:34
can irritate and damage the lungs
07:40
[Music]
07:57
you may think that not wearing a mask
07:59
doesn't matter if it's just the once but
08:02
just the once easily becomes a habit
08:04
it's not worth the risk to your health
08:25
most safety precautions mean spending a
08:28
little time thinking or preparing before
08:31
you get on with your job sometimes a few
08:34
minutes sometimes only a few seconds
08:36
these moments can be the most important
08:39
time of your life
08:50
how long would it have taken to take the
08:53
correct route around the deck away from
08:55
danger and how long does it take to
08:57
fetch a hard hat how long does it take
09:01
to stop and ask yourself if it's
09:03
dangerous to smoke
09:04
you should never smoke near access
09:07
hatches because there could be a buildup
09:09
of flammable gases many shipping
09:11
companies prohibit all smoking on deck
09:19
how long does it take to get breathing
09:22
apparatus
09:22
you should never enter an enclosed space
09:24
without testing the air and obtaining a
09:27
permit to work if required on bulk
09:30
carriers you're especially at risk from
09:32
cargoes like coal and grain
09:38
how many minutes to clear up spillage
09:41
never leave it for someone to slip on
09:45
how long does it take to get a permit to
09:48
work for a job involving welding
09:49
equipment it may take a while but it
09:52
could save your life
09:54
remember that the possibility of
09:56
flammable vapor is high on bulk carriers
09:59
how much time would it have taken to
10:01
ensure that there was nobody in the way
10:03
of the hatch cover and was this really
10:08
worth saving a few minutes
10:22
ships themselves do not cause accidents
10:26
or injury people do by ignoring obvious
10:29
safety measures in order to save a
10:31
little time that is the greatest
10:33
temptation of them all don't give in to
10:36
it never be complacent always think
10:39
about your safety and the safety of your
10:41
fellow crew members
10:46
