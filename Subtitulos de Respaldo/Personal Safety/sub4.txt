This chapter should give an introduction to the connection between near accidents
00:04
and serious or major injury different types of accidents and injuries and how
00:10
to avoid them chemical health hazards ergonomics
00:34
it was stated in the previous section that many of these accidents could have
00:39
been avoided if the near accidents had been reported a lot of these accidents
00:44
can also be avoided if the correct protection equipment safety clothing and
00:48
safety procedures are used the job of preventing injuries and accidents from
00:54
happening can be categorized as follows information and training of the
00:58
personnel ensuring that correct protective equipment is available and is
01:04
used following up reports ensuring that correct routines for maintenance are
01:10
followed avoid or reduce the risk of burns from steam heated oil boilers etc
01:16
by using gloves boiler suits and protective shoes suitable for the
01:22
purpose avoid or reduce the risk of burns from cooking by being careful and
01:27
observant avoid or reduce the risk of burns from chemicals by using gloves
01:33
special protective suits and protective shoes suitable for the purpose always
01:39
use eye protection like safety goggles or face screen when working with
01:44
chemicals corrosion protection painting or other maintenance operations use
01:50
clothing suited for the climate you are working in the parts of the body most
01:55
likely to get frozen our hands and fingers feet and toes nose and ears do
02:03
not protect your hands and feet with rags but use the proper clothing

available clothing suitable are necessary for working in cold climates
02:11
is gloves boots boiler suits jackets face masks always use a helmet when
02:21
working on deck in the engine room in tanks or cargo holes use a face mask or
02:28
other suitable breathing equipment and safety line when entering tanks and
02:33
close spaces where exposure to harmful substances is likely to occur never
02:38
enter tanks without having a standby watch positioned at the tank hatch most
02:44
injuries from falling caused by falling from lower heights
02:48
like lettuce rope ladders stairs etc falling from Heights is often fatal
02:54
always fasten the ladder use a safety belt wire or rope when practical use a
03:02
safety net when practical don't carry equipment etc in your hands when
03:08
climbing ladders tools and equipment should be lowered or hoisted with a
03:13
separate rope for in a container use safety equipment suited for the
03:19
situation and remember this equipment is there to hinder injuries to avoid
03:25
injuries caused by slipping always use the correct footwear with rubber soles
03:30
painting the deck with skid proof paint can also be a solution in areas where
03:35
slipping is likely to happen remember to clean up small quantities of oil
03:40
immediately many injuries to back and shoulders can be avoided by using
03:46
suitable lifting equipment when available using trolleys when possible
03:52
practicing correct lifting techniques use proper ear protection like ear plugs
03:58
or ear pads when working in loud noise environment we can in general say that
04:04
ear pads give the best protection against noise to avoid injuries of this
04:09
type use gloves whenever possible be aware of the fact that this is the most
04:15
common injury so be careful always use protective boots or shoes when working
04:21
on deck in tanks cargo holds and engine room there are different load factors
04:28
that may influence you in how you do your work typical load factors are
04:32
listed below it is important to use correct lifting techniques to avoid
04:37
injuries to back and shoulders if the object is very heavy and/or warm two
04:43
persons have to carry the object between them a tip for carrying objects with
04:48
both hands is as follows the consequence of incorrect lifting techniques can be
04:54
as illustrated here some general principles for carrying are as listed
04:59
you should always protect your ears when exposed to loud noise typical situations
05:05
are working in the engine room but also when you are in contact with helicopters
05:10
and other noisy machinery it is important to have enough light when
05:14
working this applies also to your leisure time for example when you are
05:19
reading seafarers working on the bridge at night are especially in need of good
05:25
night vision and that the illumination is correct when exposed to sudden bright
05:30
light it will take several minutes to adjust so that night vision is restored
05:35
this is dependent on the person's age because older seafarers take longer to
05:41
adjust the shipping company and the management onboard have a responsibility
05:46
to keep a good environment onboard welfare related measures could be as
05:51
listed television and video entertainment library containing
05:57
different kinds of literature physical training equipment CBT computer-based
06:03
training giving you an opportunity to gain new knowledge and build up your
06:08
competence seamen are to be protected from chemical health hazards where
06:14
chemical substances are stored or used the seaman is to be protected and be
06:19
able to protect himself from accidents injury and particular discomfort as well
06:25
as the risk of long-term diseases the risk of exposure to dangerous chemicals
06:29
is not only from cargo but also from chemicals that are in daily use some
06:35
symptoms of injuries by exposure to chemicals are listed below exposure to
06:41
chemicals may lead to delay diseases
