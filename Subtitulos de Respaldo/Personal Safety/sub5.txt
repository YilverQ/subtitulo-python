working traveling or playing on the
00:18
water is a way of life for Alaskans but
00:23
Alaska's cold water and harsh conditions
00:26
can quickly turn any building trip into
00:29
a life-threatening emergency
00:32
unlike marine mammals with their natural
00:34
insulation and buoyancy humans can't
00:38
survive in Alaska's water without
00:40
additional flotation and protection from
00:42
the cold

[Music]
00:52
immersion suits are designed to provide
00:54
the location and insulation persons life
00:57
depends on in a cold water emergency
00:59
emergency sometimes called survival
01:02
suits have been around for a long time
01:04
today there are a wide variety of sizes
01:07
and designs available there is no best
01:10
brand of immersion suit all should meet
01:12
United States Coast Guard standards and
01:15
have a label inside indicating Coast
01:17
Guard approval having a Coast Guard
01:22
approved immersion suit on board is just
01:24
the first step for an immersion suit to
01:26
protect you in the water it must fit
01:28
correctly be properly maintained and be
01:31
stored in an accessible location you
01:34
must also practice putting on your
01:36
immersion suit quickly to make sure you
01:38
can do so in an emergency commercial
01:42
fishing vessels operating in cold waters
01:44
are required to have an immersion suit
01:46
of the proper size for each individual
01:48
on board the only way to find your
01:51
correct size is to try on an immersion
01:54
suit make sure it will fit over the
01:56
clothes that you typically wear on deck
01:58
check to make sure the hood seals around
02:00
your face put your hands fit into the
02:03
gloves and that the suit will not ride
02:05
up over your head if it does large
02:08
amounts of water can put your through
02:10
the hood increasing your chances for
02:12
survival
02:15
if you are a v-twin sized person try
02:19
another brand of soot one grande maybe
02:21
cut too large for you while another
02:24
brand may fit perfectly in an emergency
02:31
you must be able to identify the correct
02:33
size of emergency quickly if there are
02:36
different sizes of suits on board mark
02:38
them with easily recognized objects such
02:41
as a whistle a light as an additional
02:43
reflective tape this will aid in quick
02:46
identification especially at night well
02:51
pretty good at da look the zipper on my
02:53
suit so I guess I needed you know the
02:54
suit for this trip Bob when buying a new
02:59
immersion suit take a moment to examine
03:01
the features and make sure it fits you
03:07
all immersion suits have a waterproof
03:10
zipper this is one of the most important
03:13
features of the suit take a moment to
03:15
make sure the zipper works smoothly and
03:17
has a handle that is easy to grab
03:20
immersion suits come with a wide variety
03:23
of gloves to suit individual preferences
03:25
3 or 5 finger gloves are common but may
03:28
be difficult to work in removable gloves
03:31
provide the most dexterity but they are
03:33
difficult to keep watertight it often
03:35
cause your hands to get cold quickly try
03:38
out different gloves to determine which
03:39
type best meets your needs pockets for
03:43
lights and other survival gear are an
03:45
important feature on an immersion suit
03:46
on some brands you can add pockets which
03:49
sit into the flotation collar or slide
03:52
over the arm
03:54
all immersion suits have a face flap
03:57
that protects your nose and mouth some
03:59
have velcro attached to the back of the
04:01
face flap to hold it open while donning
04:03
the suit many immersion suits also have
04:07
one-way exhaust valves built into the
04:09
legs these valves are designed to let
04:11
the air out without letting water in
04:13
they're intended to prevent trapped air
04:16
from causing a person to float head down
04:18
in the water to be Coast Guard approved
04:21
an immersion suit must include the
04:23
following items it must have 62 square
04:26
inches of retro reflective tape placed
04:29
so it can be seen when a person is
04:31
floating in the water it must have a
04:33
light with a dated battery it must have
04:36
a pillow or a collar that provides
04:38
additional floatation this additional
04:40
flotation is very important in rough
04:42
seas the floatation collar is inflated
04:45
by pressing down on the tip of the hose
04:47
with your mouth and blowing air into it
04:49
when the tip is relieves the valve
04:51
closes and air can't escape make sure
04:54
the tip of the hose moves freely without
04:56
sticking if the hose has a locking nut
04:58
make sure it is always set in the open
05:01
or down position
05:03
finally Coast Guard regulations require
05:06
emergency routes to be marked with the
05:08
name of the vessel or the owner of the
05:10
suit ask your immersion suit
05:12
manufacturer for the type of marking ink
05:14
they recommend immersion suits should be
05:18
inspected at least once each month if
05:20
properly maintained they will last many
05:22
years the zipper on an immersion suit
05:25
should receive careful attention during
05:27
each inspection Green on the zipper is a
05:30
sign of corrosion truly move corrosion
05:33
try cleaning the zipper with a
05:35
toothbrush and a slurry of baking soda
05:37
and water rinse with fresh water if any
05:40
green is still present repeat the
05:42
process if this doesn't remove all the
05:45
corrosion immediately remove the suit
05:47
from service and send to a factory
05:49
authorized facility for repair immersion
05:53
suit zippers need to be regularly
05:55
lubricated with a non petroleum
05:57
lubricant recommended by the
05:59
sure spread the lubricant on all sides
06:01
of the zipper be sure and lubricate the
06:04
locking teeth on the back of the zipper
06:06
slide the zipper up and down a few times
06:08
to spread the lubricant evenly don't
06:11
forget to lubricate the snaps on the
06:13
stowage bag to assure easy access to
06:16
your suit when you need it inspect the
06:19
suit for holes rifts burns and grease or
06:22
oil carefully inspect the scenes for
06:25
leaks in the hands crotch and other
06:27
areas repair any damaged seams with a
06:29
sealant recommended by the manufacturer
06:32
pull gently on the inflation hose to
06:35
make sure it is not loose at least once
06:40
a year inflate the floatation collar to
06:42
make sure that it will hold air
06:44
overnight check the light for any sign
06:50
of corrosion make sure to use dated
06:52
batteries and replace any that are
06:54
expired or soon to expire test the light
07:00
inspect the retro reflective tape yellow
07:04
tape should be replaced after using a
07:07
suit in a swimming pool or in salt water
07:09
rinse it thoroughly with fresh water it
07:12
is best to dry your immersion suit in a
07:14
well-ventilated area out of the weather
07:16
and out of the Sun to prevent
07:19
destructive mold and mildew it is
07:21
important to dry both the inside and the
07:23
outside of the suit in the offseason
07:27
remove your immersion suit from the bag
07:29
and store it indoors this will keep the
07:32
suit Drive and allow the neoprene
07:34
material to maintain its long it is
07:37
highly recommended that soups be
07:39
inspected once a year by an authorized
07:41
service facility emergencies must be
07:45
stowed in an accessible location out of
07:48
the weather
07:48
look around your vessel to find the best
07:51
place with ready access in all kinds of
07:53
imir
07:54
and see the zipper should be stored in
07:57
the open position with the zipper about
07:59
an inch up from the bottom this will
08:01
allow the suit to be quickly donned in
08:03
an emergency and give you room to work
08:05
the zipper down at the jamb put plastic
08:08
bags in the suit so it will be easier to
08:11
get your feet in quickly with boots or
08:13
shoes on most suits should be rolled not
08:16
folded rolled the suit up beginning at
08:19
the feet and moving up the legs be sure
08:21
the face flap is left open either inside
08:24
the hood or attached outside to the hood
08:27
on the pad provided with some brands of
08:29
suits roll the hood over the body of the
08:33
suit fold the arms across slide the suit
08:36
into the bag and snap the bag shot
08:45
a slightly different method is used for
08:48
Bailey's immersion suits
08:49
Bailey's recommends their suit be folded
08:51
along the line of the zipper fold the
08:54
suit into thirds and place the suit
08:55
inside the Bailey immersion suit bag in
09:05
an emergency seconds can make the
09:07
difference between life and death
09:09
factors the steps to correct lead on an
09:11
emergency before you leave the Daath
09:14
everyone on board should be able to don
09:16
their emergency in less than 60 seconds
09:25
remove the immersion suit with a quick
09:27
downward shake of the bag if the snaps
09:31
have been well-maintained they should
09:32
open easily roll the suit out on the
09:35
deck and sit down on the chest area near
09:38
the head sitting on the suit makes you
09:40
much more stable and eliminates the
09:43
chance of falling and injuring yourself
09:44
if the vessel moves suddenly or rolled
09:47
put your feet in and slide them all the
09:50
way to the bottom of the legs
09:52
placing plastic bags over your boots
09:54
helps your feet slip into the legs much
09:56
faster and allows you to keep your boots
09:58
on the bags can be stored in the legs of
10:01
the suit or in the hood for easy access
10:04
be aware that some brands of immersion
10:06
suits have tapered legs and require
10:08
boots or shoes to be removed before
10:10
donning the suit once your feet are in
10:13
the bottom of the immersion suit legs
10:14
kneel or stand and bring the suit over
10:17
your back put your weaker arm in first
10:20
if you're right-handed put your left arm
10:22
in the left sleeve with your right hand
10:25
secure the hood over your head without
10:27
the hood securely in place you can drown
10:29
or be washed out of your suit in rough
10:31
seas sweatshirt hoods and hats can
10:35
interfere with the emergency hood tuck
10:37
your sweatshirt hood into your collar
10:39
before donning remove your hat before
10:42
putting the immersion suit hood on if
10:45
you wear eyeglasses consider placing
10:47
them in your shirt pocket or inside the
10:49
suit to prevent loss or injury
10:51
finally place your right hand into the
10:54
right sleeve make sure the zipper is
10:58
clear with one hand hold the bottom of
11:00
the zipper down and grab the toggle with
11:02
the other hand arch your back and zip
11:05
the suit all the way up if any snags are
11:08
felt do not force them instead lower the
11:11
zipper to clear the snag and try again a
11:14
long steady pull is more effective than
11:17
stopping and starting
11:19
pull the face flap across the top of the
11:22
zipper and fasten in place with practice
11:26
immersion suit donning can be
11:28
accomplished with speed and efficiency
11:31
once you are in your emergency turn to
11:34
help others working together two people
11:36
can quickly help authorities get into
11:39
their emergency by the following
11:40
technique have the suit open on deck and
11:44
ready for the person place plastic bags
11:47
on the person's feet and guide them into
11:49
the suit once their legs are fully in
11:51
the suit have the person roll on to
11:53
their knees guide their arms into the
11:55
suit and place the fluids securely on
11:57
their head
11:58
hold the bottom of the zipper down with
12:00
one hand grasp the toggle and zip the
12:02
emergency closed with the other hand
12:04
with practice immersion suits can be
12:07
done in this manner in less than five
12:09
seconds you should abandon ship only
12:13
after determining that being on board
12:15
the vessel is more dangerous than being
12:17
in the water always enter the water
12:20
slowly and from the lowest point
12:22
possible this allows the body to adjust
12:24
to the new water environment and
12:26
minimizes the chance of injury some
12:29
vessels easing yourself slowly into the
12:31
water is not an option if you must jump
12:35
make sure the flotation collar is
12:37
deflated this will prevent injury to
12:39
your neck and back or damage to the suit
12:42
stand next to the side of the vessel
12:44
face the bow or the stern protect your
12:47
head from hitting the side of the vessel
12:49
by covering it with your inboard arm
12:51
this will also prevent the immersion
12:53
suit hood from slipping off when you
12:54
enter the water use your remaining hand
12:57
to create an opening at the neck that
12:59
will allow air to escape as you enter
13:01
the water this will prevent your
13:03
eardrums from being damaged or ruptured
13:06
with the hand of the outboard arm
13:08
protect the airway to help keep water
13:10
out during an involuntary gasps look
13:14
over the side to ensure the area is
13:15
clear step sideways off the vessel
13:18
crossing your ankles to prevent
13:20
straddling unseen objects in the water
13:23
once in the water float on your back the
13:26
Emergencies pillow or
13:28
and helps you maintain this position
13:31
forming a human chain while swimming
13:33
allows you to move faster stay together
13:36
and creates a bigger target for rescuers
13:38
to see
13:43
three or more people can form a human
13:45
raft this technique not only creates a
13:48
bigger target for rescuers
13:52
allow the group to support someone in
13:55
worse condition and keep them out of the
13:57
water when trying to attract the
14:00
attention of nearby rescuers you can
14:02
also lock elbows shoulder to shoulder
14:04
and kick your feet the splashing will
14:07
significantly increase your visibility
14:08
especially on a cold day
14:11
[Music]
14:15
you never know how your day is going to
14:17
end immersion suits will save thousands
14:22
alive but an emergency will work only if
14:25
it's properly signed Don maintain stowed
