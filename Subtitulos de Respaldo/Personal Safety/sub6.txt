Working traveling or playing on the water is a way of life for Alaskans but
00:22
Alaska's cold water and harsh conditions can quickly turn any building trip into
00:27
a life-threatening emergency unlike marine mammals with their natural
00:33
insulation and buoyancy humans can't survive in Alaska's water without
00:38
additional flotation and protection from the cold
00:44
you
00:50
immersion suits are designed to provide the flotation in insulation Britain's
00:55
life depends on in a cold water emergency immersion suits sometimes
01:00
called survival suits have been around for a long time today there are a wide
01:04
variety of sizes and designs available there is no best brand of immersion suit
01:10
all should meet United States Coast Guard standards and have a label inside
01:14
indicating Coast Guard approval having a Coast Guard approved immersion suit on
01:21
board is just the first step for an emergency to protect you in the water it
01:26
must fit correctly be properly maintained and be stored in an
01:30
accessible location you must also practice putting on your immersion suit
01:35
quickly to make sure you can do so in an emergency commercial fishing vessels
01:41
operating in cold waters are required to have an immersion suit of the proper
01:45
size for each individual on board the only way to find your correct size is to
01:51
try on an immersion suit make sure it will fit over the clothes that you
01:55
typically wear on deck check to make sure the hood seals around your face put
02:00
your hands get into the gloves and the pursuit will not ride up over your head
02:04
if it does large amounts of water can put you through the hood decreasing your
02:09
chances for survival
02:14
if you are a v-twin sized person try another brand of soot one brand made to
02:19
cut too large for you while another brand may fit perfectly in an emergency
02:29
you must be able to identify the correct size of emergency quickly if there are
02:34
different sizes of suits on board mark them with easily recognized objects such
02:39
as a whistle a light was an additional reflective
02:42
tape this will aid in quick identification especially at night hey
02:47
Pat how are you doing well pretty good at da hook the zipper on my seat so I
02:52
guess I need another suit for this trip Bob when buying a new immersion suit
02:59
take a moment to examine the features and make sure it fits you all immersion
03:07
suits have a waterproof zipper this is one of the most important features of
03:12
the suit take a moment to make sure the zipper works smoothly and has a handle
03:17
that is easy to grab immersion suits come with a wide variety of gloves to
03:22
suit individual preferences three or five finger gloves are common but may be
03:27
difficult to work in removable gloves provide the most dexterity but they are
03:31
difficult to keep watertight it often cause your hands to get cold quickly try
03:36
out different gloves to determine which type best meets your needs pockets for
03:41
lights and others survival here are an important feature on an immersion suit
03:45
on some brands you can add pockets which sit in the flotation collar or slide
03:50
over the arm all immersion suits have a face flap
03:55
that protects your nose and mouth some have velcro attached to the back of the
04:00
face flap to hold it open while donning the suit many immersion suits also have
04:05
one-way exhaust valves built into the legs these valves are designed to let
04:10
the air out without letting water in they're intended to prevent trapped air
04:14
from causing a person to float head down in the water to the Coast guard-approved
04:20
an immersion suit must include the following items it must have 62 square
04:24
inches of retro reflective tape placed so it can be seen when a person is
04:29
floating in the water it must have a light with a dated battery it must have
04:34
a pillow or a collar that provides additional floatation this additional
04:38
flotation is very important in rough seas the flotation collar is inflated by
04:43
pressing down on the tip of the hose with your mouth and blowing air into it
04:48
when the tip is relieves the valve closes and air can't escape make sure
04:52
the tip of the hose moves freely without sticking if the hose has a locking nut
04:57
make sure it is always set in the open or down position
05:02
finally Coast Guard regulations require emergencies to be marked with the name
05:06
of the vessel or the owner of the suit ask your immersion suit manufacturer for
05:11
the type of marking ink they recommend immersion suits should be inspected at
05:17
least once each month if properly maintained they will last many years the
05:22
zipper on an immersion suit should receive careful attention during each
05:26
inspection Green on the zipper is a sign of corrosion to remove corrosion try
05:32
cleaning the zipper with a toothbrush and a slurry of baking soda and water
05:36
rinse with fresh water if any green is still present repeat the process if this
05:42
doesn't remove all the corrosion immediately remove the suit from service
05:46
in to a factory authorized facility for
05:49
repair immersion suit zippers need to be regularly lubricated with a non
05:55
petroleum lubricant recommended by the manufacturer spread the lubricant on all
05:59
sides of the zipper be sure and lubricate the locking teeth on the back
06:03
of the zipper slide the zipper up and down a few times to spread the lubricant
06:08
evenly don't forget to lubricate the snaps on the stowage bag which are easy
06:13
access to your suit when you need it inspect the suit for holes rifts burns
06:19
and grease or oil carefully inspect the seams for leaks in the hands crotch and
06:25
other areas repair any damaged seams with a sealant recommended by the
06:29
manufacturer pull gently on the inflation hose to make sure it is not
06:34
loose at least once a year inflate the floatation collar to make sure that it
06:42
will hold air overnight check the light for any sign of corrosion make sure to
06:50
use dated batteries and replace any that are expired or soon to expire test the
06:56
light
06:59
inspect the retro reflective tape yellow tape should be replaced after using a
07:05
suit in a swimming pool or in salt water rinse it thoroughly with fresh water it
07:10
is best to dry your immersion suit in a well-ventilated area out of the weather
07:14
and out of the Sun to prevent destructive mold and mildew it is
07:19
important to dry both the inside and the outside of the suit in the offseason
07:26
remove your immersion suit from the bag and store it indoors this will keep the
07:30
suit Drive and allow the neoprene material to maintain its long it is
07:35
highly recommended that soups be inspected once a year by an authorized
07:39
service facility emergencies must be stowed in an accessible location out of
07:46
the weather look around your vessel to find the best place with ready access in
07:51
all kinds of emergency the zipper should be stored in the open position with the
07:56
zipper about an inch up from the bottom this will allow the suit to be quickly
08:01
donned in an emergency and give you room to work the zipper down at the jambs put
08:06
plastic bags in the suit so it will be easier to get your feet in quickly with
08:11
boots or shoes on most suits should be rolled not folded rolled the suit out
08:16
beginning at the feet and moving up the legs be sure the face flap is left open
08:22
either inside the hood or attached outside to the hood on the pad provided
08:27
with some brands of seats roll the hood over the body of the suit fold the arms
08:33
across slide the suit into the bag
08:38
and snap the bag shot a slightly different method is used for Bailey's
08:46
immersion suits Bailey's recommends their suit be folded
08:50
along the line of the zipper fold the suit into thirds and place the
08:54
suit inside the Bailey immersion suit bag in an emergency seconds can make the
09:05
difference between life and death practice the steps to correct lead on an
09:09
emergency before you leave the dock everyone on board should be able to Don
09:15
their emergency within less than 60 seconds
09:22
epilator remove the immersion suit with a quick downward shake of the back if
09:28
the snaps have been well-maintained they should open easily roll the suit out on
09:34
the deck and sit down on the chest area near the head sitting on the suit makes
09:38
you much more stable and eliminates the chance of falling and injuring yourself
09:43
if the vessel moves suddenly or rolled put your feet in and slide them all the
09:48
way to the bottom of the legs placing plastic bags over your boots
09:53
helps your feet slip into the legs much faster and allows you to keep your boots
09:57
on the bags can be stored in the legs of the suit or in the hood for easy access
10:02
be aware that some brands of emergencies have tapered legs and require boots or
10:07
shoes to be removed before donning the suit once your feet are in the bottom of
10:12
the emergency legs kneel or stand and bring the suit over your back put your
10:17
weaker arm in first if you're right-handed with your left arm in the
10:21
left sleeve with your right hand secure the hood over your head without the hood
10:26
securely in place you can drown or be washed out of your suit in rough seas
10:31
sweatshirt hoods and a half's can interfere with the emergency it would
10:35
tuck your sweatshirt hood into your collar before donning remove your hat
10:40
before putting the immersion suit hood on if you wear eyeglasses consider
10:45
placing them in your shirt pocket or inside the suit to prevent loss or
10:49
injury finally place your right hand into the
10:52
right sleeve make sure the zipper is clear with one hand hold the bottom of
10:59
the zipper down and grab the toggle with the other hand arch your back and zip
11:04
the suit all the way up if any snags are felt do not force them instead lower the
11:10
zipper to clear the snag and try again a long steady pull is more effective than
11:16
and starting pull the face flap across the top of the zipper and fastened in
11:22
place with practice immersion suit donning can be accomplished with speed
11:27
and efficiency once you are in your immersion suit
11:32
turn to help others working together two people can quickly help a corkage get
11:37
into their immersion suit by the following technique have the suit open
11:41
on deck and ready for the person place plastic bags on the person's feet and
11:46
guide them into the suit once their legs are fully in the soup have the person
11:51
roll onto their knees guide their arms into the suit place their foot securely
11:55
on their head hold the bottom of the zipper down with one hand grasp the
12:00
toggle and zip the emergency closed with the other hand with practice emergencies
12:05
can be done in this manner in less than 10 seconds you should abandon ship only
12:11
after determining that being on board the vessel is more dangerous than being
12:16
in the water always enter the water slowly and from the lowest point
12:20
possible this allows the body to adjust to the new water environment and
12:25
minimizes the chance of injury on some vessels easing yourself slowly into the
12:30
water is not an option if you must jump make sure the flotation collar is
12:36
deflated this will prevent injury to your neck and back or damage to the suit
12:40
stand next to the side of the vessel face the bow or the stern protect your
12:46
head from hitting the side of the vessel by covering it with your inboard arm
12:49
this will also prevent the emergency to it from slipping off when you enter the
12:53
water use your remaining hand to create an opening at the neck that will allow
12:58
air to escape as you enter the water this will prevent your eardrums from
13:02
being damaged or ruptured with the hand of the outboard arm protect the airway
13:08
to help keep water out during an involuntary gasps look over the side to
13:13
ensure the area is clear step sideways off the vessel crossing your ankles to
13:18
prevent straddling unseen objects in the water once in the water float on your
13:23
back emergency's pillow or vacation collar
13:26
helps you maintain this position forming a human chain while swimming allows you
13:32
to move faster stay together and creates a bigger target for rescuers to see
13:41
three or more people can form a human raft this technique not only creates a
13:46
bigger target for rescuers
13:50
it allows the group to support someone in worse condition and keep them out of
13:55
the water when trying to attract the attention of nearby rescuers you can
14:00
also lock elbows shoulder to shoulder and kick your feet the splashing will
14:05
significantly increase your visibility especially on a calm day you never know
14:15
how your day is going to end immersion suits will save thousands in life but an
14:21
emergency would work only is properly signed Don
14:27
maintain stowed and use the right way
14:37
when an emergency happens on board a vessel
