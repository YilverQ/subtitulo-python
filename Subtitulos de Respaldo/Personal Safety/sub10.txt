more short blasts followed by one long
05:02

05:06
immediately
05:07
the ship's alarm bells or Klaxons will
05:10
also be sounded in the event of a
05:12
general emergency and may be followed by
05:14
an announcement on the public address
05:15
system on some ships the general
05:19
emergency alarm system is used to give
05:21
other signals depending on where you
05:22
should master for instance at a
05:25
specified muster area or near your life
05:27
but there may also be a fire alarm
05:30
system aboard your ship which operates
05:32
independently from the general emergency
05:34
alarm find out what emergency signals
05:38
are given the board your ship what each
05:40
one means and where you should master
05:42

07:53
for posters in the accommodation showing
07:55
the correct way to don your own type of
07:57
life jacket the possibility of having to
08:08
take to the lifeboats and abandon ship
08:10
is remote but you must still know what
08:12
to do emergency drills will be practiced

08:41
the direction signs on the bulkheads
08:42
leading to the emergency exits keep low
08:46
beneath the smoke crawl if necessary as
08:49
clearer air lies close to the deck on
08:52
arrival at your master station there'll
08:54
be a roll call
08:55
yeah members of the crew assigned to
09:01
emergency duties such as firefighting
09:03
will be given instructions on what to do
09:06
next
09:06
meanwhile the lifeboats will be swung
09:09
out by designated crew members and made
09:12
ready there is a set procedure for
09:15
taking to the lifeboats this will be
09:17
explained to you during lifeboat drills
09:19
your ship is also equipped with life
09:22
rafts as an additional safeguard do not
09:25
board your lifeboat or activate life
09:27
rafts unless ordered to do so in the
09:30
unlikely event of having to abandon ship
09:32
this order will usually be given
09:34
verbally by the master

if you see somebody fall overboard shout
09:58
man overboard and throw the nearest
10:00
lifebuoy over the side raise the alarm
10:06
but above all make sure the bridge is
10:09
informed immediately the officer there
10:12
can release a smoke float which will
10:13
give the ship a marker to steer towards
10:16
you can help by keeping your eyes on the
10:18
person in the water and keep looking
10:20
until told otherwise while the ship is
10:23
maneuvering the crew will be called to
10:25
their master stations the master or
10:28
officer of the watch will take charge
10:30
this slag every emergency calls for
10:32
quick decisive action you must know what
10:44
to do if you're first on the scene of an
10:46
accident or other medical emergency and
10:48
as absolutely essential
10:50
don't you move the casualties first
10:53
raise the alarm
10:54
next inform the officer of the watch
10:56
about the emergency if you can't do this
10:59
yourself because you're attending the
11:01
casualty ask another crew member to do
11:03
it for you to reduce the risk of an
11:06
injury always wear protective clothing
11:07
when working the most common type of
11:10
accident aboard ship is a slip or a fall
11:13
therefore take particular care of decks
11:15
are wet or slippery
11:17
beware of moving machinery safety boots
11:21
should be worn while working and hard
11:24
hats when on deck or in the in general
11:27
keep the casualty calm warm and
11:30
protected until help arrives the master
11:34
and some ships officers are qualified
11:36
first aiders and can provide assistance
11:37
for most injuries they can also contact
11:41
medical experts ashore as a precaution
11:53
against flooding ships are constructed
11:55
with watertight bulkheads any opening in
11:58
a watertight bulkhead is fitted with a
12:00
watertight door sliding tight doors are
12:03
the most common closing the door
12:05
triggers an alarm if power driven
12:08
there'll also be a hand-operated
12:09
mechanism on each side in case of power
12:12
failure watertight doors should remain
12:15
closed at sea and should not be opened
12:17
without permission from a senior officer
12:21
whether tight doors have a different
12:23
purpose and are designed to keep out
12:25
wind see and spray many external doors
12:29
are of this type they often have a high
12:31
sill and have clamping devices known as
12:34
dogs to provide a tight seal fire doors
12:40
are barriers against the spread of fire
12:41
they often fitted with a heavy closing
12:44
spring and should never be hooked back
12:46
other types of fire doors may close
12:48
automatically if the fire alarm is
12:50
sounded as a rule if a door is closed
12:53
keep it closed if you see a no entry
12:56
sign done don't go in without permission
12:59
and never enter an enclosed space
13:02
without authorization if in doubt ask
13:08
this video covers the mandatory safety
13:11
familiarization training requirements in
13:13
general terms only although it's given
13:16
you a broad view of shipboard safety and
13:18
how to react in an emergency it's
13:20
essential that you familiarize yourself
13:22
completely with the alarms equipment and
13:24
routines aboard your own ship as they
13:27
may differ from what you've seen your
13:30
personal safety and the safety of others
13:32
may depend on your familiarity with
13:34
safety procedures it's up to you to
13:37
develop a good working knowledge of
13:39
safety practices from the moment you
13:41
arrive undergoing safety familiarization
13:45
is a vital part of this process and that
13:48
applies to everybody employed or engaged
13:50
on your ship even a film crew thank God
14:03
you
14:15
you
